So much so that few lawmakers have any hope of understanding its nuances. Attorneys who specialize in tax, as one of my sources points out, tend to go beyond law school to obtain a master’s degree. Tax is also a realm that demands long-term planning by individuals and businesses. Stability is important. But with the Supreme Court latest actions, “what used to be fairly settled law now becomes potentially unsettled,” says attorney Harvey Dale, who has taught tax at the New York University School of Law for more than four decades. “It’s a very, very bad outcome.”\n\nTwo rulings in particular “will bring much more litigation into the federal courts. I’m talking hundreds, maybe thousands of litigations trying to take down regulations, some of which may be 50 years old. So that unsettles planning for the entire nongovernmental sector,” Dale says.\n\nFirst and most notable is Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondi, wherein the Supreme Court majority killed the so-called Chevron deference. Chevron is the legal standard that has long guided career experts at federal agencies as they carried out the intent of Congress, translating broad legislative strokes into enforceable regulations related to climate, commerce, energy, health care, and other realms. The demise of Chevron makes it easier for special interests to successfully challenge federal agencies in court—and to tie up pending regulations with nuisance lawsuits.\n\nAdding insult to injury was Corner Post Inc. v Board of Governors, in which the majority stunned observers by ruling that the six-year statute of limitations for challenging federal regulations begins not when a regulation is first enacted, but rather when the party who brought the complaint was first affected. Corner Post puts Loper on steroids, making almost any regulation fair game.\n\nThese decisions, Dale says, “emasculate” the rulemaking ability of highly technical federal agencies, “because they’re going to be worried—correctly—about the extent to which litigation will bring them to court, and maybe invalidate their regulations.”\n\nLoper “unleashes so much chaos,” concurs Georgetown Law professor Brian Galle, who teaches courses in taxation, nonprofits, and behavioral law and economics. “I think you will see a massive wave of antiregulatory lawsuits.”\n\n“A rule of judicial humility gives way to a rule of judicial hubris,” Justice Kagan wrote in her Loper dissent. “The majority disdains restraint, and grasps for power.”\n\nTribune Media Company barely let the ink dry on the Loper ruling before mounting a challenge to IRS guidelines designed to curb what it calls “abusive basis-shifting” by partnerships. Last Wednesday, a lawyer for the IRS commissioner wrote to a federal appeals court contesting the Tribune challenge and pointing out that the agency had not relied on Chevron in its determination.\n\nThe Tribune company, the letter said, tried “to abuse federal tax rules to avoid a prodigious tax bill when it sold the Chicago Cubs and related assets. That ran afoul of, among other things, the partnership anti-abuse rule, [which] is supported by a long and unbroken history of judicial doctrines and congressional enactments empowering the IRS to combat the kind of chicanery attempted here.”\n\nThe IRS seems to have a solid case here, but that’s not the point. The point is that the agency will be forced to divert more of its hard-won and embattled resources to fend off the coming firehose of legal actions. “There’s such a long list, especially when you start talking about small businesses,” Galle says. Major law firms, Dale points out, have been reaching out to clients and holding webinars on what these rulings might mean for them. (This one highlights various “opportunities” and “avenues for challenge.”)\n\nLawmakers, too, have taken a keen interest in weaponizing Loper. Also last Wednesday, House Republican committee chairs sent letters to a host of agencies and Cabinet heads—including Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen—asking them to describe how Chevron‘s demise will affect their rulemaking. “We’ve already seen how frequently federal agencies will abuse their authority,” House Majority Leader Steve Scalise (R-La.) said in the announcement. “We intend to ensure agencies are held accountable following the court’s ruling and observe the proper checks on their power.”\n\n“The big picture to me is the court grabbing power,” says Steven Rosenthal, who drafted tax law for Congress as a former staff attorney for the bipartisan Joint Committee on Taxation. “If that goes unchecked, it vastly diminishes the ability of Congress to write statutes and the executive branch to administer them. Everything becomes an interpretive question to be resolved by the courts.”\n\nJustice Elena Kagan had a similar reaction. The Loper majority “flips the script,” she wrote in her scathing dissent (see page 82). “A rule of judicial humility gives way to a rule of judicial hubris…The majority disdains restraint, and grasps for power.”\n\nTax is a peculiar beast. Lawmakers, recognizing that they often have no clue what they’re doing, give the IRS and Treasury Department an unusual degree of statutory authority to craft workable tax rules and “fill in the details,” as Chief Justice John Roberts wrote for the Loper majority. (See page 17.)\n\n“When the best reading of a statute is that it delegates discretionary authority to an agency,” Roberts wrote, the court’s role is “to effectuate the will of Congress subject to constitutional limits.” These last four words, Rosenthal fears, may signal the court’s future willingness to rule that Congress is delegating more of its power to an agency than the Constitution allows.\n\nJustice Kagan wrote in her Loper dissent that the majority, in killing Chevron, had revived a legal test from the 1944 case Skidmore v. Swift, which held that “agency interpretations ‘constitute a body of experience and informed judgment’ that may be ‘entitled to respect,’” she wrote, but, “If the majority thinks that the same judges who argue today about where ‘ambiguity’ resides [in statutory language] are not going to argue tomorrow about what ‘respect’ requires, I fear it will be gravely disappointed.”\n\nIndeed, the issue for the IRS is that lawyers for corporations and ultrawealthy taxpayers are already starting to throw spaghetti at the wall to see what will stick.\n\nEvery time the IRS moves to close an abusive loophole, it is “interpreting the statute to say that can’t be what Congress meant,” Galle told me. Such interpretations, he says—which would include the aforementioned partnership guidelines and the IRS’s warnings about wealthy taxpayers claiming “inappropriately large deductions” for conservation easements—are now more vulnerable to legal challenges.\n\nThe justices “had the hubris to believe that they alone can solve problems. They interpret the Constitution in a way that that leaves our government in disrepair.”\n\nLet’s not forget that the IRS has only just begun to recover from decades of Republican-imposed shortfalls, and is still a long way from being fully back on track. “It’s hard to even fathom how far behind their rulemaking is,” says Galle, who is interested in rules around charitable giving. The IRS, for example, has long been mulling for donor advised funds, “the new kind of pet charities of a certain group of rich people,” he says. The agency “was supposed to create those rules in 2009, and they haven’t even proposed some of them yet.”\n\nGalle also foresees “upstream pressure” on “the drafters and the general counsel’s office” to make rules that are more resilient to litigation—“which the IRS is not staffed for: They have kind of had their hands over their eyes and their fingers in their ears to warnings that the anti-regulatory tide is eventually going to pull them out to sea.”\n\nRosenthal finds the notion of so much judicial intervention hard to stomach. If Congress doesn’t have the capacity to deal with the intricacies of tax, he says, “the courts are even worse positioned. Each justice has, like, three or four clerks who are three years out of law school. Congress at least has technical experts like myself—lawyers and economists and others.”\n\n“The court doesn’t have any of those facilities,” Rosenthal continues. “They just had the hubris to believe that they alone can solve problems. They interpret the Constitution in a way that that leaves our government in disrepair, and I think that’s by design. I think that’s what they want.”\n\nDale predicts the rulings will result in a year or two of gridlock in the federal courts, at which point “Chief Justice Roberts is going to say, this is a terrible problem and in order to allow people to have their rights determined, we need more federal judges. And the Congress is going to say okay. And so we’re going to have an enlargement of the federal judiciary, all of whom serve for life terms.”\n\nIf that happens, Dale says, whomever happens to be president will have the opportunity to make lots and lots of appointments, and “we’ll see the policy impact for 40 or 50 years.”\n\n}","feature_image":null,"featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"all","created_at":"2024-07-17 12:12:12","created_by":"1","updated_at":"2024-07-17 12:12:12","updated_by":null,"published_at":"2024-07-17 10:00:00","published_by":"1","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":"https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2024/07/supreme-court-loper-bright-corner-post-irs-tax-policy/","newsletter_id":null,"show_title_and_feature_image":1},{"id":"6697b72a114c1d143434a497","uuid":"a11dff6c-ce23-475e-af38-ec65daa66445","title":"Moms for Liberty Have Had a Rough Year.

This wasn’t my first Moms for Liberty event—I’ve attended the annual summits for the past two years. Back in 2022, Betsy DeVos, who served as former President Donald Trump’s Secretary of Education, delivered the line that got the loudest applause. “While I know that everything we did was with the interest of kids in mind and policies that would really give as much power back to the states and local communities as we possibly could,” she said, “I personally think the Department of Education should not exist.”\n\nAt the time, that statement felt a little bit edgy—like DeVos was saying the quiet part out loud. But two years later at yesterday’s event, many of the panelists expressed that same sentiment as a a foregone conclusion. “The fundamental problem that we have in the United States was the creation of the federal Department of Education,” Rep. Harriet Hageman (R-WY) told the crowd of maybe 400 or so mostly white women. In his remarks, erstwhile GOP presidential hopeful Vivek Ramaswamy said, “We’re not just going to reform the Department of Education, it means we’re going to get there and actually shut it down.”\n\nDoes that mean that a ragtag group of moms singlehandedly turned the abolition of a behemoth government agency into a run-of-the-mill conservative talking point? Not exactly. On that issue and many others, Moms for Liberty has had a major assist from powerful conservative groups that share their goals—and are shaping the Republican agenda for 2024.\n\nFounded in 2021 by three former school board members in Florida, Moms for Liberty rode the rising tide of anti-mask sentiment in the tumultuous year after schools were closed during the pandemic. The group’s leaders capitalized on the backlash to the Black Lives Matter movement after the murder of George Floyd. In fact, Moms for Liberty was one of the most prominent early groups to criticize the teaching of ant-racist curriculum in schools, which they incorrectly referred to as “critical race theory.” The group also vociferously opposed LGBTQ-inclusive lessons, and its members led campaigns to rid classrooms and school libraries of books deemed inappropriate.\n\nOver time, Moms for Liberty grew in both membership and influence. Today, the group counts 130,000 members across chapters in 48 states. The organization groomed some members to run for local school boards, gradually expanding their influence throughout communities. Last year, all of the Republican presidential candidates, including former president Donald Trump, spoke at their annual conference in Pennsylvania.\n\nIn its marketing, Moms for Liberty comes off as a group of like-minded people, mostly women, who all happened to come together because of a shared concern for children. Founders Tiffany Justice and Tina Deskovich, the website says, are just a couple of “moms on a mission to stoke the fires of liberty.” But as I’ve previously reported, the organization’s connections to the Republican party run deep. Its conferences have been sponsored by the GOP training group the Leadership Institute and the conservative powerhouse think tank the Heritage Foundation. Earlier this week, after the RNC Heritage Foundation event, Moms for Liberty national director Catalina Stubbe told me that her group is “very close friends” with Heritage, which was one of the sponsors of today’s event, and whose president Kevin Roberts spoke on one of the panels.\n\nConsidering the group’s cozy relationship with Heritage, the RNC town hall panelists’ focus on abolishing the US Department of Education shouldn’t be surprising. Project 2025, the 920-page conservative policy roadmap that Heritage spearheaded, calls for the complete elimination of the Department of Education, along with the codification of parents’ rights laws similar to those in Florida, which strictly limit teachers’ use of LGBTQ-inclusive curriculum and books.\n\nAfter the event, I spoke to Lydia Dominguez, a Moms for Liberty member running for school board in Clark County, Nevada. Dominguez, the mother of two teenage boys, told me that she believed schools “are being oversaturated by national agendas.” What kinds of national agendas? I asked. “They’re having CNN in the classroom,” she said. “They’re pushing national topics such as the transgender topics, sexualized content.”\n\nShe believed schools “are being oversaturated by national agendas…They’re having CNN in the classroom,” she said. “They’re pushing national topics such as the transgender topics, sexualized content.”\n\nMonica Kepes serves as the secretary of a Moms for Liberty chapter in Washington County, Wisconsin. “I think the big bureaucratic institutions are instituting a lot of stuff that comes down through the education system,” she said. “I think the bigger you get, the more power there is, the more chance corruption and all that kind of stuff.”\n\nAt Moms for Liberty’s upcoming 2024 summit, which will take place next month in Washington, DC, it seems unlikely that the group will be able to muster a repeat performance of the star-studded speaker roster from last year.

There has to be retribution when you have crime like this.”\n\nSeptember 29, 2020\n\nDuring his debate with Joe Biden, Trump declines an opportunity to condemn far-right violence, instead telling the Proud Boys, a group implicated in a number of violent incidents, to “stand back and stand by.”\n\nOctober 30–November 1, 2020\n\nAfter a Biden campaign bus on a tour in Texas is harassed on the interstate highway by a caravan of forty-some Trump flag-sporting trucks—causing a minor collision, endangering nearby traffic, and forcing the Biden campaign to cancel several events due to safety concerns—Trump tweets a video of the highway “Trump Train” with the comment, “I LOVE TEXAS!” The next day, he tweets, “In my opinion, these patriots did nothing wrong,” and slams the FBI’s San Antonio office for investigating the case.\n\nDecember 19, 2020\n\nTrump invites his supporters to a rally in Washington, D.C. on January 6, 2021, promising that the gathering—which turned into the attack on the Capitol—“will be wild.”\n\nShare The Bulwark\n\nJanuary 6, 2021\n\nWhen notified that attendees at his rally near the White }","feature_image":null,"featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"all","created_at":"2024-07-17 12:12:16","created_by":"1","updated_at":"2024-07-17 12:12:16","updated_by":null,"published_at":"2024-07-17 07:25:27","published_by":"1","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":"https://www.thebulwark.com/p/donald-trump-violent-rhetoric-catalogue","newsletter_id":null,"show_title_and_feature_image":1},{"id":"6697b72a114c1d143434a4b0","uuid":"4868f74f-e2ae-4d00-8f56-684b11c4f4e0","title":"‘Everything Is Going Right’—Trumpists Can’t Believe Their Own Convention","slug":"everything-is-going-right-trumpists-cant-believe-their-own-convention-2","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[[\"soft-return\",\"\",{}]],\"cards\":[[\"image\",{\"src\":\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F92498c29-bbe0-405e-84e2-a52838823c6c_5392x3592.jpeg\",\"caption\":\"Attendees hold signs during the second day of the 2024 Republican National Convention at the Fiserv Forum in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, July 16, 2024.

The Trump-Vance policy is founded on unsavory affinities and personal grievances dressed up in arguments that sound “realistic” and “hard-headed” yet collapse on even cursory inspection. This is a golden opportunity for Joe Biden—or, preferably, a younger substitute, more capable of raising the issue and making the argument—to set the Trump-Vance ticket on its back foot.\n\nTake a moment to pass this article along.\n\nShare\n\nAaron L.

He pardoned, in addition to Flynn, his convicted former campaign manager, Paul Manafort. He commuted the sentence of his longtime political ally, Roger Stone. He even pardoned his daughter Ivanka’s father-in-law, Charles Kushner, who had been convicted on multiple counts of tax evasion connected with a prostitution/revenge-porn scheme to retaliate against a federal witness against him—his brother-in-law!\n\nSecuring impunity for allies remains a consistent theme with Trump. During his current run for president, he has loudly proclaimed his intent to “free” people who have been convicted for crimes related to their participation in the violence of January 6th. He has even suggested he would consider pardoning the members of the Proud Boys convicted of seditious conspiracy.\n\nThere, too, the contrast with President Biden is stark. After his son Hunter was convicted for unlawful possession of a firearm as a person using or addicted to drugs, the president pledged to neither pardon nor commute any sentence Hunter receives. Indeed, the very fact that the attorney general appointed a special counsel to independently investigate and pursue charges against the president’s son would be unimaginable in a second Trump administration.\n\nEqual justice before the law requires a president whose Justice Department holds criminal actors to account without fear or favor. Corruption and its deterrence are on the ballot.\n\nGold bars may bring temporary happiness, but reading the Bulwark brings a lifetime of pleasure.

Biden was enabling a “border bloodbath,” crowd signs read, as congressional leaders accused Biden of enabling a border “invasion.”\n\nNor was it new to see them use provocative, inflammatory, or extremist rhetoric to talk about immigrants and the Democratic incumbents. “Every day Americans are dying,” Texas Sen. Ted Cruz thundered, “murdered, assaulted, and raped by illegal immigrants that the Democrats have released.”\n\nWhat was clear is how the Republican Party of 2024 has fine-tuned its anti-immigration message for the American electorate of 2024: focusing on drugs, human trafficking, crime, and public disorder, and distinguishing between “illegal” immigrants who threaten the fabric of America and the right kind of migrant.\n\nKari Lake, the election-denying GOP Senate candidate from Arizona, summed it up early in the night: The goal of the GOP must be to “stop the Bidenvasion and build the wall.”\n\nThis all happened the night after Republican organizers tried to preach national unity in the aftermath of the attempted assassination of Donald Trump, and some speakers said they toned down their speeches.\n\nBut the Republican Party’s position on immigration might be more unifying than it looks. The data shows that Americans are much more against all kinds of immigration and more likely to favor more stringent border controls and immigration policies than when Trump ran for office the first or second time.\n\nIndeed, the America of 2024 is more anti-immigrant than in the recent past, more skeptical of immigration, and more open to policies that would have seemed extreme if they had been enacted when Trump was in office. This is in part because there really was an influx of migrants and a spike in border-crossing after Biden took office and as the pandemic wound down.\n\nThis anti-immigrant shift has been quick but sustained. Since 2020, the share of Americans wanting the level of all immigration to decrease has shot up, from 28 percent in the middle of 2020 to 55 percent as of June 2024, according to Gallup polling data.\n\nThose analysts note that 2024 is the first time since 2005 that the majority of the American public has wanted less immigration and that this anti-immigration sentiment is at its highest point since 2001, when the country was going through another bout of anti-immigrant fervor after the 9/11 terrorist attacks.\n\nThose shifts are also happening across all sectors of the electorate. It’s not just white voters. Nonwhite voters and especially Latino voters are more likely than in the past to want less immigration, and anti-immigrant sentiment is rising across all partisan groups, including among Democrats.\n\nDuring the Trump years, the overall mood of the country shifted to be more pro-immigrant as Democratic voters became much more positive about immigration. That trend has shifted, even over the past year.\n\nThe opinions don’t lack nuance. Voters are much more positive on legal migration than illegal immigration. They are more supportive of building a wall along the southern border with Mexico than they were during the Trump years, but they are also still receptive to providing a pathway to citizenship for those immigrants brought illegally into the United States as children (though even support for these Dreamers has steadily dropped).\n\nOverall, though, when thinking about the border and immigration, many Americans now seem to view the issue less as one about humanitarianism and human rights, and more through the lens of law and order, immigration researchers have observed.\n\nAll of this was reflected in the position many Republican rising stars, candidates, and elected officials took on Tuesday night. Senate candidates, including Bernie Moreno of Ohio, Lake of Arizona, and Eric Hovde of Wisconsin, as well as former candidates Vivek Ramaswamy and Nikki Haley, all talked about the benefits of legal immigration and the American dream while playing up the threat of fentanyl trafficking and immigrant drains on the American economy.\n\nThey warned of the threat that an “invasion” at the southern border posed to the American dream. Moreno, himself a Colombian immigrant, emphasized that he and his parents immigrated to the US “legally” — then attacked Biden and Democrats for “encourag[ing] millions of illegals to invade America.”\n\nOther Republican leaders, like House Majority Leader Steve Scalise and Speaker Mike Johnson, played up the threat of non-citizen voting changing the fabric of the nation, “harm[ing] citizens, drain[ing] resources, and disrupt[ing] elections,” as Johnson said.\n\nThe night’s closing message rounded out this critique of the status quo: “You can’t have a nation without borders.” It’s a simple pitch to those Americans who view migration as a question of order and process: upset at images of migrant caravans and river crossings, even if they don’t necessarily dislike the idea of extending the American dream.\n\nIn 2019, while Trump was in office, this strategic speech might not have resonated with most Americans. But in 2024, it’s ringing true to a growing share of the electorate.\n\n}","feature_image":null,"featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"all","created_at":"2024-07-17 12:12:17","created_by":"1","updated_at":"2024-07-17 12:12:17","updated_by":null,"published_at":"2024-07-17 04:15:00","published_by":"1","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":"https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/361155/rnc-2024-republican-immigration-border-biden-policy-invasion-legal-gop","newsletter_id":null,"show_title_and_feature_image":1},{"id":"6697b72a114c1d143434a4b7","uuid":"70ab2c82-826b-4576-97d3-8548c16eeb44","title":"The crime wave is over but Republicans can’t let go","slug":"the-crime-wave-is-over-but-republicans-cant-let-go-2","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"image\",{\"src\":\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/gettyimages-2162320348.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0,0,100,100\",\"caption\":\"An attendee holds a “Make America Safe Again” sign during the second day of the 2024 Republican National Convention at the Fiserv Forum in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. | Brendan Smialowski/AFP via Getty Images\"}]],\"markups\":[[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/361155/rnc-2024-republican-immigration-border-biden-policy-invasion-legal-gop\",\"rel\",\"noopener noreferrer\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://www.vox.com/policy/24139552/crime-rates-falling-tough-laws-mass-incarceration\",\"rel\",\"noopener noreferrer\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/new-fbi-stats-show-historic-declines-violent-crime-rate-murder-showing-rcna156573\",\"rel\",\"noopener noreferrer\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://www.vox.com/policy/356269/falling-crime-trends-public-perception-voter-concerns\",\"rel\",\"noopener noreferrer\"]],[\"strong\"],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://www.themarshallproject.org/2024/03/09/louisiana-georgia-kentucky-tough-on-crime\",\"rel\",\"noopener noreferrer\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://www.vox.com/politics/360318/project-2025-trump-policies-abortion-divorce\",\"rel\",\"noopener noreferrer\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://www.americanprogress.org/article/project-2025-compels-local-prosecutors-to-enforce-extreme-right-wing-laws/\",\"rel\",\"noopener noreferrer\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://www.vera.org/annual-report-2022/voters-reject-fearmongering-around-crime-and-public-safety-in-2022-midterms\",\"rel\",\"noopener noreferrer\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://apnews.com/article/new-york-city-subway-national-guard-crime-f046ecaac79601f6113efa8a0c8f25c7\",\"rel\",\"noopener noreferrer\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/oregon-governor-signs-a-bill-recriminalizing-drug-possession#:~:text=SALEM%2C%20Ore.,was%20hobbled%20by%20implementation%20issues.\",\"rel\",\"noopener noreferrer\"]]],\"sections\":[[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"{\\\"url\\\":https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/gettyimages-2162320348.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C10.725655622849%2C100%2C78.548688754302&w=1200, \\\"desc\\\":\"]]],[10,0],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"“Horrific crimes.

That was the case in New York, for example, where the Democratic governor sent the National Guard to patrol the subway, and in Oregon, where lawmakers recriminalized drugs after voters in 2020 decriminalized them.\n\nIf the second night of the Republican convention was any indication, it’s that, despite falling crime rates, the GOP’s old law-and-order campaign playbook isn’t likely to go away anytime soon.\n\n}","feature_image":null,"featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"all","created_at":"2024-07-17 12:12:17","created_by":"1","updated_at":"2024-07-17 12:12:17","updated_by":null,"published_at":"2024-07-17 04:50:44","published_by":"1","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":"https://www.vox.com/politics/361165/rnc-2024-make-america-safe-again-trump-gop-false-crime-wave","newsletter_id":null,"show_title_and_feature_image":1},{"id":"6697b72a114c1d143434a4b8","uuid":"288a4987-8525-47ab-acb0-698437603ec4","title":"Who Is Usha Vance, J.D.

Vance said during the same interview that his wife’s faith was a key factor in his decision to re-engage with Christianity later in his life, which he says Usha has been supportive of.\n\nAsked if she’s ready for the scrutiny “that comes with being Second Lady,” Usha Vance told Fox: “I’m not raring to change anything about our lives right now, but I believe in J.D. and really love him, and so we’ll just sort of see what happens with our life.” She also suggested it was too soon to discuss what political causes she may champion if her husband becomes Vice President.\n\n}","feature_image":null,"featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"all","created_at":"2024-07-17 12:12:17","created_by":"1","updated_at":"2024-07-17 12:12:17","updated_by":null,"published_at":"2024-07-17 03:35:00","published_by":"1","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":"https://time.com/6999385/usha-vance-jd-wife-indian-american-yale-law-hindu/","newsletter_id":null,"show_title_and_feature_image":1},{"id":"6697b72a114c1d143434a4b9","uuid":"41163428-837a-46f9-b7cf-bdcaa83f5b54","title":"Once Trump’s Fiercest Rival, Nikki Haley Makes the Case for Republicans Uniting Behind Him","slug":"once-trumps-fiercest-rival-nikki-haley-makes-the-case-for-republicans-uniting-behind-him-2","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"image\",{\"src\":\"https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-2162338461.jpg\",\"alt\":\"2024 Republican National Convention: Day 2\"}],[\"image\",{\"src\":\"https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/trump-haley-endorsement-rnc.jpg\",\"alt\":\"US-REPUBLICAN-CONVENTION-PARTIES-ELECTION-POLITICS-VOTE\"}]],\"markups\":[[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://time.com/6552240/nikki-haley-trump-iowa-republican-debate/\",\"rel\",\"noopener noreferrer\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://time.com/6972021/donald-trump-2024-election-interview/\",\"rel\",\"noopener noreferrer\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://time.com/6252040/nikki-haley-donald-trump-relationship-history/\",\"rel\",\"noopener noreferrer\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://time.com/6305440/vivek-ramaswamy-interview-republican-primary/\",\"rel\",\"noopener noreferrer\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://time.com/4506350/donald-trump-ted-cruz-insults/\",\"rel\",\"noopener noreferrer\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://time.com/6305193/ron-desantis-interview-education-parents-2024/\",\"rel\",\"noopener noreferrer\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://time.com/6998302/trump-rally-shooting-2/\",\"rel\",\"noopener noreferrer\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://time.com/6852965/donald-trump-nikki-haley-republicans/\",\"rel\",\"noopener noreferrer\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://time.com/6883158/nikki-haley-suspend-campaign-next/\",\"rel\",\"noopener noreferrer\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://time.com/6696857/nikki-haley-south-carolina-republican-primary-trump/\",\"rel\",\"noopener noreferrer\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://time.com/6564888/ron-desantis-ends-presidential-bid/\",\"rel\",\"noopener noreferrer\"]]],\"sections\":[[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"{\\\"url\\\":https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-2162338461.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1, \\\"desc\\\":\"]]],[10,0],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"A few months ago, \"],[0,[0],1,\"Nikki Haley\"],[0,[],0,\" was one of \"],[0,[1],1,\"Donald Trump\"],[0,[],0,\"’s fiercest opponents.

large portions of the West over the next few days.\"\n * Some 227 million people in the U.S. will see temperatures exceed 90°F during the next week, per Weatherbell Analytics.\n\nContext: Studies show climate change, mostly driven by the burning of fossil fuels such as coal and natural gas, has greatly increased the likelihood of heat waves, causing them to be longer lasting and more intense.\n\n * Last year was the hottest on record and NOAA data shows that 19 of the 20 warmest years on record have happened since 2000.\n\nGo deeper: Increasingly costly heat waves present insurance

the update in a statement Monday, adding that investigators are continuing to analyze Crooks' electronic devices.\n\n * The bureau also said it has received \"hundreds of digital media tips which include photos and videos taken at the scene\" that it is reviewing.\n * However, NBC News reported Monday that a preliminary analysis of Crooks' phone hasn't helped investigators determine a motive for the attack.\n\nFlashback: In 2016, Apple refused to help federal law enforcement unlock a phone belonging to the shooter in an attack in San Bernardino, California.\n\n * Federal law enforcement has since found alternatives for cracking a suspect's iPhone encryption without Apple's help.\n\nYes, but: The FBI did not say whether a tech company had helped the bureau gain access to Crooks' phone or if it instead relied on its own tools to unlock the device.\n\n * It's easier than most people think for law enforcement to break the encryption on phones running iOS or Android.\n * The FBI also

Thanks to the rain last night, the Jamboree at the RNC, the official celebration party on the first night of the Republican National Convention, was mostly empty. Still, DJ Milk N Cooks was in the corner, pumping out beats, and there was Susan, dancing with abandon, glittering flag earrings dangling from her ears. She’d come all the way from Texas as a guest of a convention attendee, she told me, and she was so happy. She’d been confident in the GOP candidate before, but now she knew: Trump had survived and would go on to win.\n\n“If you didn’t believe in miracles before, now you do,” Susan, who declined to share her last name, told me. And if you didn’t believe in Trump? I asked, continuing the thought. “Now you do,” she said.\n\nThe word unity has been thrown around a lot at the convention in Wisconsin this week. After the shooting at his rally in Pennsylvania on Saturday night, Trump said he’d be rewriting his Thursday speech to focus on unity. Ambassador Nikki Haley, who wasn’t originally invited to speak at the convention, is now getting top billing for tonight’s program, in what appears to be a conciliatory gesture to the moderate wing of the party. Per the Trump loyalist Vivek Ramaswamy, Republicans “actually want national unity. Not some fake version, but the real thing.” These appeals for national comity did, now and again, seem to have a coercive edge.\n\n[John Hendrickson: ‘Everything is in place now’]\n\nAfter the attack on Trump, which left him with a bandaged ear but also resulted in a death and two serious injuries at the Pennsylvania rally, many convention attendees are calling for national togetherness. It’s a miracle that Trump survived the shooting, they say, and it’s time for all of America to stand together in the face of “evil,” as Trump called it. But what Republicans really seem to mean is that all of America now needs to stand together behind Trump.\n\nThis year’s convention is a mishmash of events occurring not only at the Fiserv Forum arena but also throughout Milwaukee’s downtown area, with each evening featuring a roster of brand-name GOP speakers. Yesterday, a series of welcome breakfasts and a screening of the new Dennis Quaid and Jon Voight movie, Reagan, preceded the evening’s events. People enjoyed themselves at a restaurant near the arena sponsored by CNN and Politico and, on the upper levels of the arena, drank cans of Spotted Cow, confident that the combination of Trump’s aging opponent and the former president’s own new status as a heroic survivor of political violence would ensure that he glides back into the White House in January.\n\nEvery national GOP convention intends to bring Republicans closer together. The occasion is supposed to provide an opportunity to look past differences, showcase burgeoning party talent, and just generally have a good time. “But this is a time where I think the message is ‘unity for the whole U.S.,’” Linda Ivell, a GOP activist from Bradenton, Florida, told me. Trump’s candidacy “is not just for Republicans. It’s for Democrats who’ve been abused too. It’s more of a common good for the country than a Democrat-Republican thing.”\n\nTrump’s supporters know an act of God when they see one. How could you not interpret Trump’s survival as a miracle—and an indication of the kind of messianic leader he is meant to be? “There isn’t anybody that couldn’t think there was divine intervention. Because, less than five inches, the man would’ve been dead or brain-dead,” AJ Janson, an alternate delegate and a former state committeewoman from Sarasota County, Florida, told me in between speakers last night. “But he was saved by a little nod of the head at the right time.” At this point, Trump has been impeached twice, prosecuted, and shot at. “He is truly an American hero, and we all have to stand behind him,” Janson said.\n\n[David A. Graham: The next Republican leader]\n\nRepublicans believe that Trump’s brush with death has sent some new voters their way. His response to the shooting—to stand up, ear bloodied, and raise his fist—demonstrated true courage, they argue. Could Biden have done that? they ask. The assassination attempt “has caused everybody, or maybe most people, to reevaluate their positions,” Tom Trocine, a bearded Orlando man wearing camo Crocs, told me. “I know a bunch of independents, a bunch of libertarian people who were on the fence,” he added. “And now they are saying things that I hadn’t heard them say before”—that the Trump hatred had gone too far, that Trump deserved a second look.\n\nThe problem is that, so far, the convention’s speakers have not ratcheted down their rhetoric. Last night’s lineup included Senator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, who called the Democratic Party a “clear and present danger,” and Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, who delivered a speech slamming undocumented immigrants and trans people and followed it with an interview accusing Democrats of murder.\n\nAt 9 p.m., after most of the speakers had finished, Trump made his first public appearance since the shooting, walking into the arena like a gladiator to battle, a white gauze bandage covering his injured ear.

Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.) said in a statement that the incident raised “grave concerns” about the security measures taken — or not taken — to protect Trump, while Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) wrote on social media that “any third grader would know that it’d be malpractice not to have personnel on the rooftop where the shooter was positioned.” Others called for resignations of agency leadership. \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nCheryl Tyler, a former Secret Service agent, said “a lot of work” goes into preparing for major events involving protected individuals. Typically, an advanced team of agents is assembled to liaise with local law enforcement, search for vulnerabilities on location and map out contingency plans.\n\n\n\n \n\n\nThe shooter took aim at the former president from a rooftop outside the venue, about 150 meters from where Trump was speaking — a little farther than a football field’s length away.\n\n\n\n \n\n\nWhen it comes to determining the placement of a secure perimeter, there is no “rubber-stamping” or “definitive answer,” Tyler said of the Secret Service’s process.\n\n\n \n\n\n“The question is, why or why not did the secure perimeter go further? I don’t know those answers — only those who did the advance know those answers,” Tyler said, suggesting the question is one investigators will likely seek to answer. \n\n\n \n\n\nThe FBI was deemed the lead investigator of the incident, which its director, Christopher Wray, called “nothing short of an attack on democracy and our democratic process.”\n\n\n \n\n\n\nRead the full report at TheHill.com.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWelcome to The Hill’s Defense & National Security newsletter, I'm Ellen Mitchell — your guide to the latest developments at the Pentagon, on Capitol Hill and beyond.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDid someone forward you this newsletter?

It will also play on a roving mobile billboard around the Republican National Convention’s perimeter during Vance’s first official speech as Trump’s vice presidential pick, which he is expected to make Wednesday evening in Milwaukee.\n\nOn the ground at the Wisconsin convention, several RNC delegates and alternates—mostly women—told me they were thrilled with the selection of Vance because they share his abortion beliefs, which at times have included no exceptions for either rape or incest. “Two wrongs don’t make a right,” he said a few years ago, according to the Washington Post. Moreover, in a 2022 Senate debate, Vance said he approved of states making their own reproductive laws, but clarified that he was “totally fine” with a “minimum national standard” on abortion.\n\nIn recent months, Vance and the broader GOP have quieted their rhetoric on abortion, perhaps in response to how the issue has alienated voters, including many Republicans. According to Pew Research Center, 63 percent of Americans say abortion “should be legal in all or most cases.” Among Republican and lean-Republican voters, more than 40 percent support abortion in all or most cases.\n\nDistinct from 2016, this year’s Republican National Committee platform does not explicitly include support of a 2o-week federal restriction on abortion, nor does it mention a bill that would amend the Constitution to say life begins at conception. (But as my colleague Julianne McShane reported, one of the three project leads behind the platform said of the document: “There’s not as many words describing it, but there’s protection under the Constitution, that life is protected.”)\n\nThe DNC’s new ad attempts to remind voters of the more hardline views the GOP, Trump, and Vance have shared in recent history. For example, a testy exchange between Trump and former MSNBC “Hardball” host Chris Matthews back from 2016:\n\n“Do you believe in punishment for abortion, yes or no?

June’s rulings bode far worse, for both the natural environment and efforts to combat climate change. Colleague Nina Martin has examined how the new rulings will be weaponized to gut reproductive rights. The New Republic’s Timothy Noah covered how they may affect the banking sector—and the economy. Others have looked at impacts on health care. And so I set out to determine the extent of the chaos the court’s rulings will unleash on the federal tax system.\n\nShort answer: Nobody knows, but it won’t be pretty.\n\nLoper “unleashes so much chaos,” says Georgetown Law professor Brian Galle. “I think you will see a massive wave of antiregulatory lawsuits.”\n\nTax law is extraordinarily complicated. So much so that few lawmakers have any hope of understanding its nuances. Attorneys who specialize in tax, as one of my sources points out, tend to go beyond law school to obtain a master’s degree. Tax is also a realm that demands long-term planning by individuals and businesses. Stability is important. But with the Supreme Court latest actions, “what used to be fairly settled law now becomes potentially unsettled,” says attorney Harvey Dale, who has taught tax at the New York University School of Law for more than four decades. “It’s a very, very bad outcome.”\n\nTwo rulings in particular “will bring much more litigation into the federal courts. I’m talking hundreds, maybe thousands of litigations trying to take down regulations, some of which may be 50 years old. So that unsettles planning for the entire nongovernmental sector,” Dale says.\n\nFirst and most notable is Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondi, wherein the Supreme Court majority killed the so-called Chevron deference. Chevron is the legal standard that has long guided career experts at federal agencies as they carried out the intent of Congress, translating broad legislative strokes into enforceable regulations related to climate, commerce, energy, health care, and other realms. The demise of Chevron makes it easier for special interests to successfully challenge federal agencies in court—and to tie up pending regulations with nuisance lawsuits.\n\nAdding insult to injury was Corner Post Inc. v Board of Governors, in which the majority stunned observers by ruling that the six-year statute of limitations for challenging federal regulations begins not when a regulation is first enacted, but rather when the party who brought the complaint was first affected. Corner Post puts Loper on steroids, making almost any regulation fair game.\n\nThese decisions, Dale says, “emasculate” the rulemaking ability of highly technical federal agencies, “because they’re going to be worried—correctly—about the extent to which litigation will bring them to court, and maybe invalidate their regulations.”\n\nLoper “unleashes so much chaos,” concurs Georgetown Law professor Brian Galle, who teaches courses in taxation, nonprofits, and behavioral law and economics. “I think you will see a massive wave of antiregulatory lawsuits.”\n\n“A rule of judicial humility gives way to a rule of judicial hubris,” Justice Kagan wrote in her Loper dissent. “The majority disdains restraint, and grasps for power.”\n\nTribune Media Company barely let the ink dry on the Loper ruling before mounting a challenge to IRS guidelines designed to curb what it calls “abusive basis-shifting” by partnerships. Last Wednesday, a lawyer for the IRS commissioner wrote to a federal appeals court contesting the Tribune challenge and pointing out that the agency had not relied on Chevron in its determination.\n\nThe Tribune company, the letter said, tried “to abuse federal tax rules to avoid a prodigious tax bill when it sold the Chicago Cubs and related assets. That ran afoul of, among other things, the partnership anti-abuse rule, [which] is supported by a long and unbroken history of judicial doctrines and congressional enactments empowering the IRS to combat the kind of chicanery attempted here.”\n\nThe IRS seems to have a solid case here, but that’s not the point. The point is that the agency will be forced to divert more of its hard-won and embattled resources to fend off the coming firehose of legal actions. “There’s such a long list, especially when you start talking about small businesses,” Galle says. Major law firms, Dale points out, have been reaching out to clients and holding webinars on what these rulings might mean for them. (This one highlights various “opportunities” and “avenues for challenge.”)\n\nLawmakers, too, have taken a keen interest in weaponizing Loper.

I promise.”\n\nFebruary 22, 2016\n\nTrump reacts to a nonviolent heckler in Las Vegas, Nevada with nostalgia for more violent times: “You know what they used to do to guys like that when they were in a place like this? They’d be carried out on a stretcher, folks. . . . I’d like to punch him in the face, I tell you.”\n\nGet 30 day free trial\n\nMarch 4, 2016\n\nAfter a protester interrupts a rally in Warren, Michigan, Trump tells the crowd, “Get him out. Try not to hurt him. If you do, I’ll defend you in court.”\n\nMarch 9, 2016\n\nAt a rally in Fayetteville, North Carolina, Trump says, “All right, get him out, thank you; we’re gonna have such fun, such fun tonight” after a protester is sucker-punched while being escorted out. (It’s unclear whether Trump saw the punch.) Trump later complains about protesters at his rallies: “They put their hand up and they put the wrong finger in the air . . . and they get away with murder. Because we’ve become weak.”\n\nMarch 11, 2016\n\nAt a rally in St. Louis, Missouri, Trump complains that using violence against putative protesters is frowned upon: “They’re allowed to get up and interrupt us horribly and we have to be very, very gentle. They can swing, they can hit people but if we hit them back it’s a terrible, terrible thing.” (Sen. Ted Cruz—then Trump’s rival in the GOP primary, not yet his sycophant—claims Trump’s campaign “affirmatively encourages violence.”)\n\nAugust 9, 2016\n\nAt a rally in Wilmington, North Carolina, Trump tells his supporters that Hillary Clinton will abolish gun owners’ rights if elected, then adds, “If she gets to pick her judges, nothing you can do, folks. Although the Second Amendment people—maybe there is, I don’t know.” Trump later claims he was simply saying that Second Amendment supporters are a powerful voting bloc who can stop Clinton, but in context, his remark clearly referred to something that “the Second Amendment people” could do after Clinton’s election victory.\n\nJuly 28, 2017\n\nAt an appearance in Brentwood, New York, Trump boasts about encouraging police officers to manhandle suspects: “When you see these thugs being thrown into the back of a paddy wagon, you just see them thrown in, rough. I said, ‘Please don’t be too nice.’ . . . When you guys put somebody in the car and you’re protecting their head you know, the way you put their hand over [their head]. . . . Like, ‘Don’t hit their head and they’ve just killed somebody, don’t hit their head.’ I said, ‘You can take the hand away, okay?’”\n\nOctober 18, 2018\n\nAt a rally in Missoula, Montana, Trump gives an extended riff praising Greg Gianforte—then a congressman, now the governor of Montana—for assaulting reporter Ben Jacobs in May 2017 during his campaign for the House seat. Gianforte was convicted of misdemeanor assault in June 2017 after pleading guilty. BTo Trump, this is a point in his favor: “Any guy that can do a body slam, he is my type!”\n\nMay 9, 2019\n\nAt a rally in Pensacola, Florida, Trump plays standup comedian in response to a suggestion that migrants should be shot at the border. After complaining that border agents aren’t allowed to “use weapons” against border-crossers, he adds, “I would never do that. But how do you stop these people?” When someone shouts out, “Shoot them,” Trump chuckles, pauses to let the audience cheer and laugh, then delivers his punchline: “That’s only in the Panhandle you can get away with that statement. Only in the Panhandle,” and basks in the wild applause and laughter. (In October of that year, there were reports—not contested by Trump—that in White House discussions of the migrant problem, he had suggested shooting border-crossers in the legs.)\n\nKeep up with all our articles, newsletters, podcasts, and livestreams:\n\nApril 17, 2020\n\nIn a series of all-caps tweets, Trump urges protesters against COVID-19 lockdowns in blue states to “liberate” their states and seems to encourage the use of weapons by stressing the Second Amendment and supposed perils to it.\n\nMay 1, 2020\n\nTrump tweets again in support of Michigan anti-lockdown protesters who had swarmed the statehouse the previous day, many of them displaying handguns and rifles—and some carrying placards with such inscriptions as “Make treason punishable by hanging” and “Tyrants get the rope.”\n\nSeptember 12, 2020\n\nIn a Fox News interview discussing the fatal shooting of an Antifa-connected murder suspect by federal marshals, Trump frames it (and praises it) not as law enforcement action against an armed and dangerous subject, but as an extrajudicial execution: “That’s the way it has to be. There has to be retribution when you have crime like this.”\n\nSeptember 29, 2020\n\nDuring his debate with Joe Biden, Trump declines an opportunity to condemn far-right violence, instead telling the Proud Boys, a group implicated in a number of violent incidents, to “stand back and stand by.”\n\nOctober 30–November 1, 2020\n\nAfter a Biden campaign bus on a tour in Texas is harassed on the interstate highway by a caravan of forty-some Trump flag-sporting trucks—causing a minor collision, endangering nearby traffic, and forcing the Biden campaign to cancel several events due to safety concerns—Trump tweets a video of the highway “Trump Train” with the comment, “I LOVE TEXAS!” The next day, he tweets, “In my opinion, these patriots did nothing wrong,” and slams the FBI’s San Antonio office for investigating the case.\n\nDecember 19, 2020\n\nTrump invites his supporters to a rally in Washington, D.C. on January 6, 2021, promising that the gathering—which turned into the attack on the Capitol—“will be wild.”\n\nShare The Bulwark\n\nJanuary 6, 2021\n\nWhen notified that attendees at his rally near the White  }","feature_image":null,"featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"all","created_at":"2024-07-17 12:15:10","created_by":"1","updated_at":"2024-07-17 12:15:10","updated_by":null,"published_at":"2024-07-17 07:25:27","published_by":"1","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":"https://www.thebulwark.com/p/donald-trump-violent-rhetoric-catalogue","newsletter_id":null,"show_title_and_feature_image":1},{"id":"6697b72a114c1d143434a514","uuid":"dd2e58c5-ab18-41b2-b349-7f8d56e076e6","title":"‘Everything Is Going Right’—Trumpists Can’t Believe Their Own Convention","slug":"everything-is-going-right-trumpists-cant-believe-their-own-convention-3","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[[\"soft-return\",\"\",{}]],\"cards\":[[\"image\",{\"src\":\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F92498c29-bbe0-405e-84e2-a52838823c6c_5392x3592.jpeg\",\"caption\":\"Attendees hold signs during the second day of the 2024 Republican National Convention at the Fiserv Forum in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, July 16, 2024.

So, too, did Haley, who used her address not to suggest that delegates “vote their conscience” (as Trump’s main primary opponent in 2016, Ted Cruz, had done at the Republican convention that year), but to call on those in the crowd to “join together as a party.”\n\nOff in the Illinois delegation, a woman booed the former UN ambassador, only to be hushed by a fellow attendee: “She’s on our team now!”\n\nAND WHAT A TEAM IT IS—a mix of the party’s most controversial personalities and its senior officeholders, all held together with cult-like bindings.\n\nRep. Marjorie Taylor Greene sat for part of the evening in the VIP section behind Trump, while Laura Loomer, the conspiracy theorist who once handcuffed herself to Twitter’s NYC offices to protest getting banned, walked throughout the crowd. Some attendees wore fake ear bandages to mimic Trump’s own. Up on the dais House Speaker Mike Johnson called Republicans the “law-and-order team” while down on the floor conventiongoers held up signs celebrating the pending nomination of a convicted felon.\n\nKeep up with all our coverage of the 2024 campaign:\n\n“I think it’s a combination of things,” former Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker said of how the GOP’s various factions have all come together. “I think the overstepping by liberals and prosecutors . . . caused a lot of Republicans to say, ‘Maybe we had differences in the primary season, but this can happen to anybody.’ And then you combine that with what just happened this week, and Americans, not just Republicans here, are very passionate that we want to be united.”\n\nBut it wouldn’t be right to label this a convention of unity. For one, the unity being preached by Trump and others pertains solely to Republicans; there’s no talk of bridging divides with Democrats. Moreover, for all the former Trump foes who have turned up in Milwaukee, there are also the Republicans who chose not to come. Trump’s former vice president, Mike Pence, tweeted that he was in Montana. The last Republican president before Trump, George W. Bush, may as well have not existed. The last GOP presidential nominee before Trump, Senator Mitt Romney, now qualifies as a villain. And the majority of Trump’s former cabinet has stayed away.\n\nIn any other cycle, those absences would be the main storyline—not just a blemish on the convention, but a major warning sign about the election ahead. But this cycle is different. This cycle, the mood feels, for now, just right.\n\n“It was the best first day ever,” said Ron Kaufman, a GOP operative who has attended every convention since Barry Goldwater’s in 1964. “It’s even better comparing it to what the Democrats have right now.”\n\nKaufman insisted that he wasn’t counting the election over just yet. But he couldn’t quite mask the strength of his confidence.\n\n“It’s crazy,” he said from the convention floor. “Everything is going right.”\n\nMake your friends’ inboxes great again: Send them this article.\n\nShare\n\n}","feature_image":null,"featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"all","created_at":"2024-07-17 12:15:10","created_by":"1","updated_at":"2024-07-17 12:15:10","updated_by":null,"published_at":"2024-07-17 05:43:58","published_by":"1","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":"https://www.thebulwark.com/p/republican-convention-day-two-trump-confidence","newsletter_id":null,"show_title_and_feature_image":1},{"id":"6697b72a114c1d143434a515","uuid":"1b5dc3b8-16c3-495d-b160-28bc533ce755","title":"What Trump-Vance Means for Ukraine","slug":"what-trump-vance-means-for-ukraine-3","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"image\",{\"src\":\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffef5e077-1a3e-4693-a690-fe865cc5f19b_2100x1500.jpeg\"}]],\"markups\":[[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c72ver6172do\",\"rel\",\"noopener noreferrer\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://x.com/RonFilipkowski/status/1495091506952159233\",\"rel\",\"noopener noreferrer\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://thehill.com/policy/international/4523753-orban-says-trump-wont-give-a-penny-to-ukraine-after-mar-a-lago-meeting/\",\"rel\",\"noopener noreferrer\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://www.thebulwark.com/p/what-trump-vance-means-for-ukraine?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share\",\"rel\",\"noopener noreferrer\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/643601/americans-say-not-helping-ukraine-enough.aspx\",\"rel\",\"noopener noreferrer\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://clerk.house.gov/Votes/2024151\",\"rel\",\"noopener noreferrer\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://www.thebulwark.com/p/republican-convention-isolationism-putin-ukraine\",\"rel\",\"noopener noreferrer\"]],[\"em\"],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"http://www.twitter.com/AaronFriedberg\",\"rel\",\"noopener noreferrer\"]]],\"sections\":[[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"{\\\"url\\\":https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1200,h_600,c_fill,f_jpg,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffef5e077-1a3e-4693-a690-fe865cc5f19b_2100x1500.jpeg, \\\"desc\\\":\"]]],[10,0],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"DONALD TRUMP’S SELECTION of Senator J.D.

The selection of Vance opens the door for the Democrats to make the impending doom of Ukraine under a Trump administration a salient issue in the campaign.\n\nAccording to a Gallup poll taken in March, “Fifty-five percent of Americans think the U.S. should continue to support Ukraine in reclaiming its territory, even if that requires prolonged involvement, rather than ending the conflict as quickly as possible.” Just as significantly, the Republican party is split over the issue. Nearly half of the Republican caucus in the House voted for the Ukraine aid package that House Speaker Mike Johnson finally brought to the floor for a vote in late April. Ukraine thus presents the Democrats with a classic wedge issue. Notwithstanding the isolationism on display at the GOP convention, a considerable fraction of the Republican party does not support the Trump-Vance position. And if the terrible implications of that position are forcefully spelled out, that fraction could grow. While their erstwhile champion has thrown in her lot with Trump, some of those Nikki Haley voters who rejected his “America First-ism” and continue to think of themselves as “Reagan Republicans” could still be up for grabs.\n\nIn waging a debate over the Ukraine question, Vance and company are certain to trot out the argument they have been making for some time: that Ukraine is a distraction from the main threat to the United States, namely, an aggressive China. But this is a masterpiece of illogic wrapped inside a red herring. Nothing could do more to call into question America’s strategic resolve and endurance, thereby encouraging Chinese aggression against Taiwan, than a failure to stand up for Ukraine. (Not that there is any evidence that Trump cares an iota about Taiwan’s security. “Taiwan took our chip business away from us,” he told Bloomberg Businessweek in a new interview. “I mean how stupid are we? They took all of our chip business. They’re immensely wealthy. . . . I don’t think we’re any different from an insurance policy. Why? Why are we doing this?”)\n\nWhat’s more, pulling the rug out from under our European allies would also make it far less likely that they will join us in taking a tough line against Beijing on critical trade and technology issues, as well as on Taiwan. Such a blunder would make it easier to fragment the global coalition of democracies that Xi Jinping and Putin rightly fear could prevent them from achieving their ambitions. And what Trump and Vance are proposing could tempt other potential aggressors, like Iran and North Korea, to engage in adventurism of their own.\n\nThe stakes in Ukraine are thus global in scope, But the debate over whether to stand by it in its fight for survival also has important implications here at home. The Trump-Vance policy is founded on unsavory affinities and personal grievances dressed up in arguments that sound “realistic” and “hard-headed” yet collapse on even cursory inspection. This is a golden opportunity for Joe Biden—or, preferably, a younger substitute, more capable of raising the issue and making the argument—to set the Trump-Vance ticket on its back foot.\n\nTake a moment to pass this article along.\n\nShare\n\nAaron L.

President Trump’s properties offer these groups unbridled access to the nation’s most powerful policy makers.\n\nThis was all clear at the time. As David Leonhardt and Ian Prasad Philbrick put it in a deeply researched New York Times opinion article in October 2018, “They don’t even try very hard to hide it. President Trump, his family and more than a few of his appointees are using his presidency to enrich themselves.”\n\nLeonhardt and Philbrick went on to describe how, “unlike previous presidents, Trump is directing money to his own business on his trips. In one three-month period last year [i.e., 2017], the Secret Service spent about $63,000 at Mar-a-Lago and more than $137,000 on golf carts at Trump’s Florida and New Jersey clubs.”\n\nTrump’s cabinet members followed the leader. And as they say, the fish rots from the head. Leonhardt and Philbrick gave specifics:\n\nScott Pruitt, the former E.P.A. head, asked his staff members to contact Republican donors with the goal of helping his wife find a job. . . . Pruitt’s many scandals led to his resignation in July. Elaine Chao, the transportation secretary, used interviews with Chinese and Chinese-American media to raise her father’s profile.\n\nOther examples abound. The interior secretary who left amid a hailstorm of allegations of illegal use of government resources. The FEMA director forced to repay the government after spending taxpayer dollars on his personal travel expenses. The officials who invested in companies they were regulating. Did any of the gang that couldn’t keep straight get prosecuted? If they did, my bad—I missed it.\n\nSecond, think back to Trump’s long track record of using his Justice Department and pardon power as tools of political muscle, favoring his friends and partisan allies with release from accountability to the law. Recall how Attorney General Bill Barr sought to overturn the guilty pleas, secured by Special Counsel Robert S. Mueller, of Michael Flynn, Trump’s first national security advisor, and how Trump pardoned Flynn on the eve of the last Thanksgiving of his administration.\n\nKeep up with all our articles, newsletters, podcasts, and livestreams:\n\nBarr also appointed one-time Connecticut U.S. Attorney John Durham special prosecutor to try to undo the Mueller Report and get revenge on Democrats. Durham produced only two prosecutions, both tangential to the Trump-Russia investigation. In both cases, he faceplanted for lack of compelling evidence.\n\nThe instances of Trump relieving friends and family of criminal accountability were legion. He pardoned, in addition to Flynn, his convicted former campaign manager, Paul Manafort. He commuted the sentence of his longtime political ally, Roger Stone. He even pardoned his daughter Ivanka’s father-in-law, Charles Kushner, who had been convicted on multiple counts of tax evasion connected with a prostitution/revenge-porn scheme to retaliate against a federal witness against him—his brother-in-law!\n\nSecuring impunity for allies remains a consistent theme with Trump. During his current run for president, he has loudly proclaimed his intent to “free” people who have been convicted for crimes related to their participation in the violence of January 6th. He has even suggested he would consider pardoning the members of the Proud Boys convicted of seditious conspiracy.\n\nThere, too, the contrast with President Biden is stark. After his son Hunter was convicted for unlawful possession of a firearm as a person using or addicted to drugs, the president pledged to neither pardon nor commute any sentence Hunter receives. Indeed, the very fact that the attorney general appointed a special counsel to independently investigate and pursue charges against the president’s son would be unimaginable in a second Trump administration.\n\nEqual justice before the law requires a president whose Justice Department holds criminal actors to account without fear or favor. Corruption and its deterrence are on the ballot.\n\nGold bars may bring temporary happiness, but reading the Bulwark brings a lifetime of pleasure.

Biden was enabling a “border bloodbath,” crowd signs read, as congressional leaders accused Biden of enabling a border “invasion.”\n\nNor was it new to see them use provocative, inflammatory, or extremist rhetoric to talk about immigrants and the Democratic incumbents. “Every day Americans are dying,” Texas Sen. Ted Cruz thundered, “murdered, assaulted, and raped by illegal immigrants that the Democrats have released.”\n\nWhat was clear is how the Republican Party of 2024 has fine-tuned its anti-immigration message for the American electorate of 2024: focusing on drugs, human trafficking, crime, and public disorder, and distinguishing between “illegal” immigrants who threaten the fabric of America and the right kind of migrant.\n\nKari Lake, the election-denying GOP Senate candidate from Arizona, summed it up early in the night: The goal of the GOP must be to “stop the Bidenvasion and build the wall.”\n\nThis all happened the night after Republican organizers tried to preach national unity in the aftermath of the attempted assassination of Donald Trump, and some speakers said they toned down their speeches.\n\nBut the Republican Party’s position on immigration might be more unifying than it looks. The data shows that Americans are much more against all kinds of immigration and more likely to favor more stringent border controls and immigration policies than when Trump ran for office the first or second time.\n\nIndeed, the America of 2024 is more anti-immigrant than in the recent past, more skeptical of immigration, and more open to policies that would have seemed extreme if they had been enacted when Trump was in office. This is in part because there really was an influx of migrants and a spike in border-crossing after Biden took office and as the pandemic wound down.\n\nThis anti-immigrant shift has been quick but sustained. Since 2020, the share of Americans wanting the level of all immigration to decrease has shot up, from 28 percent in the middle of 2020 to 55 percent as of June 2024, according to Gallup polling data.\n\nThose analysts note that 2024 is the first time since 2005 that the majority of the American public has wanted less immigration and that this anti-immigration sentiment is at its highest point since 2001, when the country was going through another bout of anti-immigrant fervor after the 9/11 terrorist attacks.\n\nThose shifts are also happening across all sectors of the electorate. It’s not just white voters. Nonwhite voters and especially Latino voters are more likely than in the past to want less immigration, and anti-immigrant sentiment is rising across all partisan groups, including among Democrats.\n\nDuring the Trump years, the overall mood of the country shifted to be more pro-immigrant as Democratic voters became much more positive about immigration. That trend has shifted, even over the past year.\n\nThe opinions don’t lack nuance. Voters are much more positive on legal migration than illegal immigration. They are more supportive of building a wall along the southern border with Mexico than they were during the Trump years, but they are also still receptive to providing a pathway to citizenship for those immigrants brought illegally into the United States as children (though even support for these Dreamers has steadily dropped).\n\nOverall, though, when thinking about the border and immigration, many Americans now seem to view the issue less as one about humanitarianism and human rights, and more through the lens of law and order, immigration researchers have observed.\n\nAll of this was reflected in the position many Republican rising stars, candidates, and elected officials took on Tuesday night.

The result could be a renewed and further entrenched era of mass incarceration.\n\n\nThe GOP’s focus on crime might not work\n\nSurveys have shown that Americans always tend to think crime rates are getting worse, even when the opposite is true, but there’s a limit to how successful law-and-order campaigns can be. Recently, the Republican messaging hasn’t necessarily paid electoral dividends.\n\nAccording to the Vera Institute of Justice, for example, the 2022 midterms showed that Republicans’ fear-mongering rhetoric on crime didn’t seem to resonate with voters. Republicans spent millions of dollars on campaign ads focusing on crime and public safety, but according to exit surveys commissioned by Vera Action, the lobbying group aligned with the Vera Institute of Justice, while voters were concerned about crime, they didn’t necessarily believe in more punitive policies.\n\nStill, there’s a reason Republicans are focusing their rhetoric on crime: Democrats have been on the defensive on the issue, despite the fact that the data is in their favor.\n\nInstead of continuing to champion progressive changes to the criminal justice system, many Democrats have reversed course and pushed for harsher enforcement, fearing voter sentiment around crime. That was the case in New York, for example, where the Democratic governor sent the National Guard to patrol the subway, and in Oregon, where lawmakers recriminalized drugs after voters in 2020 decriminalized them.\n\nIf the second night of the Republican convention was any indication, it’s that, despite falling crime rates, the GOP’s old law-and-order campaign playbook isn’t likely to go away anytime soon.\n\n}","feature_image":null,"featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"all","created_at":"2024-07-17 12:15:11","created_by":"1","updated_at":"2024-07-17 12:15:11","updated_by":null,"published_at":"2024-07-17 04:50:44","published_by":"1","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":"https://www.vox.com/politics/361165/rnc-2024-make-america-safe-again-trump-gop-false-crime-wave","newsletter_id":null,"show_title_and_feature_image":1},{"id":"6697b72a114c1d143434a51c","uuid":"4ab10b1e-c7cf-4085-9d39-a9bc8dc7433e","title":"Who Is Usha Vance, J.D.

Vance said during the same interview that his wife’s faith was a key factor in his decision to re-engage with Christianity later in his life, which he says Usha has been supportive of.\n\nAsked if she’s ready for the scrutiny “that comes with being Second Lady,” Usha Vance told Fox: “I’m not raring to change anything about our lives right now, but I believe in J.D. and really love him, and so we’ll just sort of see what happens with our life.” She also suggested it was too soon to discuss what political causes she may champion if her husband becomes Vice President.\n\n}","feature_image":null,"featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"all","created_at":"2024-07-17 12:15:11","created_by":"1","updated_at":"2024-07-17 12:15:11","updated_by":null,"published_at":"2024-07-17 03:35:00","published_by":"1","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":"https://time.com/6999385/usha-vance-jd-wife-indian-american-yale-law-hindu/","newsletter_id":null,"show_title_and_feature_image":1},{"id":"6697b72a114c1d143434a51d","uuid":"dbee187e-0c91-4643-a44c-0d2cdac841d6","title":"Once Trump’s Fiercest Rival, Nikki Haley Makes the Case for Republicans Uniting Behind Him","slug":"once-trumps-fiercest-rival-nikki-haley-makes-the-case-for-republicans-uniting-behind-him-3","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"image\",{\"src\":\"https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-2162338461.jpg\",\"alt\":\"2024 Republican National Convention: Day 2\"}],[\"image\",{\"src\":\"https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/trump-haley-endorsement-rnc.jpg\",\"alt\":\"US-REPUBLICAN-CONVENTION-PARTIES-ELECTION-POLITICS-VOTE\"}]],\"markups\":[[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://time.com/6552240/nikki-haley-trump-iowa-republican-debate/\",\"rel\",\"noopener noreferrer\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://time.com/6972021/donald-trump-2024-election-interview/\",\"rel\",\"noopener noreferrer\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://time.com/6252040/nikki-haley-donald-trump-relationship-history/\",\"rel\",\"noopener noreferrer\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://time.com/6305440/vivek-ramaswamy-interview-republican-primary/\",\"rel\",\"noopener noreferrer\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://time.com/4506350/donald-trump-ted-cruz-insults/\",\"rel\",\"noopener noreferrer\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://time.com/6305193/ron-desantis-interview-education-parents-2024/\",\"rel\",\"noopener noreferrer\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://time.com/6998302/trump-rally-shooting-2/\",\"rel\",\"noopener noreferrer\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://time.com/6852965/donald-trump-nikki-haley-republicans/\",\"rel\",\"noopener noreferrer\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://time.com/6883158/nikki-haley-suspend-campaign-next/\",\"rel\",\"noopener noreferrer\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://time.com/6696857/nikki-haley-south-carolina-republican-primary-trump/\",\"rel\",\"noopener noreferrer\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://time.com/6564888/ron-desantis-ends-presidential-bid/\",\"rel\",\"noopener noreferrer\"]]],\"sections\":[[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"{\\\"url\\\":https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-2162338461.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1, \\\"desc\\\":\"]]],[10,0],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"A few months ago, \"],[0,[0],1,\"Nikki Haley\"],[0,[],0,\" was one of \"],[0,[1],1,\"Donald Trump\"],[0,[],0,\"’s fiercest opponents.

large portions of the West over the next few days.\"\n * Some 227 million people in the U.S. will see temperatures exceed 90°F during the next week, per Weatherbell Analytics.\n\nContext: Studies show climate change, mostly driven by the burning of fossil fuels such as coal and natural gas, has greatly increased the likelihood of heat waves, causing them to be longer lasting and more intense.\n\n * Last year was the hottest on record and NOAA data shows that 19 of the 20 warmest years on record have happened since 2000.\n\nGo deeper: Increasingly costly heat waves present insurance

the update in a statement Monday, adding that investigators are continuing to analyze Crooks' electronic devices.\n\n * The bureau also said it has received \"hundreds of digital media tips which include photos and videos taken at the scene\" that it is reviewing.\n * However, NBC News reported Monday that a preliminary analysis of Crooks' phone hasn't helped investigators determine a motive for the attack.\n\nFlashback: In 2016, Apple refused to help federal law enforcement unlock a phone belonging to the shooter in an attack in San Bernardino, California.\n\n * Federal law enforcement has since found alternatives for cracking a suspect's iPhone encryption without Apple's help.\n\nYes, but: The FBI did not say whether a tech company had helped the bureau gain access to Crooks' phone or if it instead relied on its own tools to unlock the device.\n\n * It's easier than most people think for law enforcement to break the encryption on phones running iOS or Android.\n * The FBI also

Thanks to the rain last night, the Jamboree at the RNC, the official celebration party on the first night of the Republican National Convention, was mostly empty. Still, DJ Milk N Cooks was in the corner, pumping out beats, and there was Susan, dancing with abandon, glittering flag earrings dangling from her ears. She’d come all the way from Texas as a guest of a convention attendee, she told me, and she was so happy. She’d been confident in the GOP candidate before, but now she knew: Trump had survived and would go on to win.\n\n“If you didn’t believe in miracles before, now you do,” Susan, who declined to share her last name, told me. And if you didn’t believe in Trump? I asked, continuing the thought. “Now you do,” she said.\n\nThe word unity has been thrown around a lot at the convention in Wisconsin this week. After the shooting at his rally in Pennsylvania on Saturday night, Trump said he’d be rewriting his Thursday speech to focus on unity. Ambassador Nikki Haley, who wasn’t originally invited to speak at the convention, is now getting top billing for tonight’s program, in what appears to be a conciliatory gesture to the moderate wing of the party. Per the Trump loyalist Vivek Ramaswamy, Republicans “actually want national unity. Not some fake version, but the real thing.” These appeals for national comity did, now and again, seem to have a coercive edge.\n\n[John Hendrickson: ‘Everything is in place now’]\n\nAfter the attack on Trump, which left him with a bandaged ear but also resulted in a death and two serious injuries at the Pennsylvania rally, many convention attendees are calling for national togetherness. It’s a miracle that Trump survived the shooting, they say, and it’s time for all of America to stand together in the face of “evil,” as Trump called it. But what Republicans really seem to mean is that all of America now needs to stand together behind Trump.\n\nThis year’s convention is a mishmash of events occurring not only at the Fiserv Forum arena but also throughout Milwaukee’s downtown area, with each evening featuring a roster of brand-name GOP speakers. Yesterday, a series of welcome breakfasts and a screening of the new Dennis Quaid and Jon Voight movie, Reagan, preceded the evening’s events. People enjoyed themselves at a restaurant near the arena sponsored by CNN and Politico and, on the upper levels of the arena, drank cans of Spotted Cow, confident that the combination of Trump’s aging opponent and the former president’s own new status as a heroic survivor of political violence would ensure that he glides back into the White House in January.\n\nEvery national GOP convention intends to bring Republicans closer together. The occasion is supposed to provide an opportunity to look past differences, showcase burgeoning party talent, and just generally have a good time. “But this is a time where I think the message is ‘unity for the whole U.S.,’” Linda Ivell, a GOP activist from Bradenton, Florida, told me. Trump’s candidacy “is not just for Republicans. It’s for Democrats who’ve been abused too. It’s more of a common good for the country than a Democrat-Republican thing.”\n\nTrump’s supporters know an act of God when they see one. How could you not interpret Trump’s survival as a miracle—and an indication of the kind of messianic leader he is meant to be? “There isn’t anybody that couldn’t think there was divine intervention. Because, less than five inches, the man would’ve been dead or brain-dead,” AJ Janson, an alternate delegate and a former state committeewoman from Sarasota County, Florida, told me in between speakers last night. “But he was saved by a little nod of the head at the right time.” At this point, Trump has been impeached twice, prosecuted, and shot at. “He is truly an American hero, and we all have to stand behind him,” Janson said.\n\n[David A. Graham: The next Republican leader]\n\nRepublicans believe that Trump’s brush with death has sent some new voters their way. His response to the shooting—to stand up, ear bloodied, and raise his fist—demonstrated true courage, they argue. Could Biden have done that? they ask. The assassination attempt “has caused everybody, or maybe most people, to reevaluate their positions,” Tom Trocine, a bearded Orlando man wearing camo Crocs, told me. “I know a bunch of independents, a bunch of libertarian people who were on the fence,” he added. “And now they are saying things that I hadn’t heard them say before”—that the Trump hatred had gone too far, that Trump deserved a second look.\n\nThe problem is that, so far, the convention’s speakers have not ratcheted down their rhetoric.

Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.) said in a statement that the incident raised “grave concerns” about the security measures taken — or not taken — to protect Trump, while Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) wrote on social media that “any third grader would know that it’d be malpractice not to have personnel on the rooftop where the shooter was positioned.” Others called for resignations of agency leadership. \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nCheryl Tyler, a former Secret Service agent, said “a lot of work” goes into preparing for major events involving protected individuals. Typically, an advanced team of agents is assembled to liaise with local law enforcement, search for vulnerabilities on location and map out contingency plans.\n\n\n\n \n\n\nThe shooter took aim at the former president from a rooftop outside the venue, about 150 meters from where Trump was speaking — a little farther than a football field’s length away.\n\n\n\n \n\n\nWhen it comes to determining the placement of a secure perimeter, there is no “rubber-stamping” or “definitive answer,” Tyler said of the Secret Service’s process.\n\n\n \n\n\n“The question is, why or why not did the secure perimeter go further? I don’t know those answers — only those who did the advance know those answers,” Tyler said, suggesting the question is one investigators will likely seek to answer. \n\n\n \n\n\nThe FBI was deemed the lead investigator of the incident, which its director, Christopher Wray, called “nothing short of an attack on democracy and our democratic process.”\n\n\n \n\n\n\nRead the full report at TheHill.com.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWelcome to The Hill’s Defense & National Security newsletter, I'm Ellen Mitchell — your guide to the latest developments at the Pentagon, on Capitol Hill and beyond.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDid someone forward you this newsletter?
