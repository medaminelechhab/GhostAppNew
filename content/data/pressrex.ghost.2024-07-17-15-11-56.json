Results in early June indicated unsafe levels of E. coli bacteria, followed by recent improvements.\n\nThe Seine will host several open water swimming events during the Games, including marathon swimming at the Olympic Games and the swimming legs of the Olympic and Paralympic triathlons.\n\n—Barbara Surk in Nice, France contributed to this report.\n\nhttps://time.com/6999479/paris-mayor-anne-hidalgo-swim-seine-clean-river-olympics/","feature_image":null,"featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"all","created_at":"2024-07-17 12:48:54","created_by":"1","updated_at":"2024-07-17 12:48:54","updated_by":null,"published_at":"2024-07-17 07:45:00","published_by":"1","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":"https://time.com/6999479/paris-mayor-anne-hidalgo-swim-seine-clean-river-olympics/","newsletter_id":null,"show_title_and_feature_image":1},{"id":"6697d31010579c2fd4f6c2ed","uuid":"a4288689-188d-47d2-8e93-5432a310ea9e","title":"Jon Stewart: We ‘Dodged a Catastrophe’ With Trump Shooting","slug":"jon-stewart-we-dodged-a-catastrophe-with-trump-shooting-2","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"image\",{\"src\":\"https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1682,w_2989,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1721195620/JS_z6ydho\"}]],\"markups\":[],\"sections\":[[10,0]],\"ghostVersion\":\"3.0\"}","lexical":null,"html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1682,w_2989,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1721195620/JS_z6ydho\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\"></figure>","comment_id":"6697bdb6e27079000113bfe0","plaintext":null,"feature_image":null,"featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"all","created_at":"2024-07-17 12:48:54","created_by":"1","updated_at":"2024-07-17 12:48:54","updated_by":null,"published_at":"2024-07-17 04:45:39","published_by":"1","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":"https://www.thedailybeast.com/jon-stewart-we-dodged-a-catastrophe-with-trump-shooting","newsletter_id":null,"show_title_and_feature_image":1},{"id":"6697d31010579c2fd4f6c2ee","uuid":"0c9a9c90-debd-4145-982d-cd89ed495d95","title":"Who Is Usha Vance, J.D.

Vance said during the same interview that his wife’s faith was a key factor in his decision to re-engage with Christianity later in his life, which he says Usha has been supportive of.\n\nAsked if she’s ready for the scrutiny “that comes with being Second Lady,” Usha Vance told Fox: “I’m not raring to change anything about our lives right now, but I believe in J.D. and really love him, and so we’ll just sort of see what happens with our life.” She also suggested it was too soon to discuss what political causes she may champion if her husband becomes Vice President.\n\nhttps://time.com/6999385/usha-vance-jd-wife-indian-american-yale-law-hindu/","feature_image":null,"featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"all","created_at":"2024-07-17 12:48:54","created_by":"1","updated_at":"2024-07-17 12:48:54","updated_by":null,"published_at":"2024-07-17 03:35:00","published_by":"1","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":"https://time.com/6999385/usha-vance-jd-wife-indian-american-yale-law-hindu/","newsletter_id":null,"show_title_and_feature_image":1},{"id":"6697d31010579c2fd4f6c2ef","uuid":"fe874373-e641-408f-bfb1-ed30e681f7d5","title":"‘House of the Dragon’ Showcases the Limits of Girlboss Feminism","slug":"house-of-the-dragon-showcases-the-limits-of-girlboss-feminism-2","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"image\",{\"src\":\"https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1688,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1721173524/240716-house-of-dragons-tease_pxc8xp\"}]],\"markups\":[],\"sections\":[[10,0]],\"ghostVersion\":\"3.0\"}","lexical":null,"html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1688,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1721173524/240716-house-of-dragons-tease_pxc8xp\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\"></figure>","comment_id":"6697bdb6e27079000113bfec","plaintext":null,"feature_image":null,"featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"all","created_at":"2024-07-17 12:48:54","created_by":"1","updated_at":"2024-07-17 12:48:54","updated_by":null,"published_at":"2024-07-17 08:30:12","published_by":"1","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":"https://www.thedailybeast.com/obsessed/house-of-the-dragon-showcases-the-limits-of-girlboss-feminism","newsletter_id":null,"show_title_and_feature_image":1},{"id":"6697d31010579c2fd4f6c2f0","uuid":"aa98164f-a01c-49af-824c-263076b41d9b","title":"Malaysia Looks to Criminalize Cyberbullying After TikTok User’s Death","slug":"malaysia-looks-to-criminalize-cyberbullying-after-tiktok-users-death","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"image\",{\"src\":\"https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/tiktok-malaysia-suicide-cyberbullying.jpg?quality=85&w=1024&h=628&crop=1\"}],[\"image\",{\"src\":\"https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/tiktok-malaysia-suicide-cyberbullying.jpg\",\"alt\":\"The TikTok logo is seen on a mobile device screen\"}]],\"markups\":[[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://www.bernama.com/en/crime_courts/news.php?id=2317067\",\"rel\",\"noopener noreferrer\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2024/07/17/two-tiktok-users-charged\",\"rel\",\"noopener noreferrer\"]],[\"em\"],[\"strong\"],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://www.iasp.info/suicidalthoughts/\",\"rel\",\"noopener noreferrer\"]]],\"sections\":[[10,0],[10,1],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"The death of a Malaysian TikTok user has prompted the government to look into criminalizing cyberbullying and increasing accountability among internet service providers.\"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"Rajeswary Appahu was found dead from apparent suicide on July 5, a day after the 30-year-old lodged a police report over online threats she had received, local media \"],[0,[0],1,\"reported\"],[0,[],0,\".

When the armed man moved toward the unarmed man, police fired their weapons.\n\n“Someone’s life was in danger,” Norman said. “These officers, who were not from this area, took it upon themselves to act and save someone’s life today.”\n\nThousands of officers from multiple jurisdictions are in Milwaukee providing additional security for the convention that began Monday and concludes Thursday.\n\nRead More: How and When to Watch the 2024 Republican and Democratic Conventions\n\nThe shooting fueled anger from residents who questioned why out-of-state officers were in their neighborhood located about a mile from the convention site.\n\nThe Columbus Division of Police, as well as the chief of staff for Milwaukee’s mayor and a spokesperson for the convention’s joint command center, all said there was nothing to suggest the shooting was related to the convention itself.\n\nA cousin and others identified the man killed as 43-year-old Samuel Sharpe.\n\nMilwaukee residents and activists quickly converged on the site of the shooting, many of them expressing outrage about the involvement of a police department in town because of the convention.\n\nAbout 100 people held a vigil and march without incident on Tuesday night, pausing for a moment of silence at the blood-stained spot where Sharpe was killed.\n\n“They came into our community and shot down our family right here at a public park,” said Linda Sharpe, a cousin of the man who was killed. “What are you doing in our city, shooting people down?”\n\nLinda Sharpe said her cousin lived in a tent encampment across the street from King Park, where the shooting occurred.\n\nResidents said the encampment was a long-standing feature of the neighborhood, which is home to several social service clinics and a shelter. Some said Milwaukee police officers are familiar with many of those living in the tents and might have been able to deescalate the situation.\n\nRead More: History Suggests the Supreme Court’s Homelessness Ruling Will Only Make the Problem Worse\n\nDavid Porter, who said he knew Samuel Sharpe and is also homeless, was angry that officers from outside of Milwaukee were in his neighborhood.\n\n“If MPD would have been there, that man would still be alive right now,” Porter said, referring to Milwaukee police.\n\nNorman, the Milwaukee chief, said 13 officers who were part of a bicycle patrol from Columbus were within their assigned zone having a meeting when they saw the altercation.\n\n“The officers observed a subject armed with a knife in each hand, engaged in an altercation with another unarmed individual,” Norman said. They only fired after the armed man ignored multiple commands and moved toward the unarmed man, the chief said.\n\n“This is a situation where somebody’s life was in immediate danger,” Norman said.\n\nThe Columbus Division of Police has received attention because of its special unit deployed to Milwaukee that works to improve police-community relationships and had a visible role in guiding the largely uneventful protests on Monday.\n\nThe shooting happened near King Park, roughly a mile from the convention center, where a small group of protesters gathered before marching on Monday. That demonstration was followed by dozens of Columbus police officers, wearing blue vests that read: “Columbus Police Dialogue.”\n\nThe Milwaukee County Medical Examiner’s Office said an autopsy was scheduled for Wednesday.\n\nhttps://time.com/6999394/officers-fatally-shot-man-blocks-away-rnc/","feature_image":null,"featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"all","created_at":"2024-07-17

It produces about 90% of all advanced microchips globally.\n\nThe US' relationship with Taiwan is likely to be a sore point should former President Donald Trump secure a second term in office.\n\nTrump, the Republican presidential nominee, said to Bloomberg Businessweek about Taiwan's dominance in the chip industry that made the island rich. He offered no evidence in the interview to support his claims about Taiwan.\n\n\"Taiwan took our chip business from us,\" he told Businessweek in an interview before the failed assassination attempt on Saturday. \"I mean, how stupid are we? They took all of our chip business. They're immensely wealthy.\"\n\nTaiwan is a semiconductor chip powerhouse. It produces 92% of the world's most advanced microchips, according to the US-based Semiconductor Industry Association.\n\nIn 2021, Taiwan's chip industry generated $137 billion in output and accounted for nearly 25% of total global chip sales, according to the US International Trade Commission in a November report.\n\nTaiwan's chipmakers benefit US companies. TSMC is the world's largest contract chipmaker: The company supplies chips to end users in America like Apple, which uses them in their consumer products. AI chipmaker Nvidia is also a big TSMC customer.\n\nHowever, Beijing claims self-governed Taiwan as its own territory and has been stepping up military activity around the island in recent years. That has sparked fears of a Chinese invasion of the island that could majorly impact the global economy and chip supply.\n\nThe US is ramping up chip manufacturing at home to diversify some of its chip supply from Taiwan with the $52 billion CHIPS for America Act that was signed into law by President Joe Biden in August 2022.\n\nThe US is still obliged by law to protect Taiwan by providing the island with military means to defend itself.\n\n\"I think, Taiwan should pay us for defense,\" Trump told Bloomberg. \"You know, we're no different than an insurance company. Taiwan doesn't give us anything.\"\n\nTaiwan-listed shares of chip powerhouse Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company stock fell as much as 3% on Thursday following Trump's complaints.\n\nIn response to Trump's statement, Taiwanese Premier Cho Jung-tai said on Thursday that the US and Taiwan maintain a good relationship and that Taipei has strengthened its defense budget.\n\n\"We are willing to take on more responsibility to defend ourselves and ensure our security,\" Cho said at a scheduled press conference.\n\n\nChina probably hasn't decided if it prefers Trump or Biden\n\nIt's not the first time Trump has complained about Taiwan's dominance in the chip business. Last July, he also griped to Fox News about the same issue.\n\n\"Remember this, Taiwan took our business away. We should have stopped them, we should have taxed them, tariffed them,\" he said at the time.\n\nChina earlier highlighted the US' potential turnaround from Biden's stance that the US would come to the defense of Taiwan if it's attacked.\n\n\"The United States always pursues 'America First,' and Taiwan may change from a 'chess piece' to a 'discarded piece' at any time,\" said Chen Binhua, a spokesman for China's Taiwan Affairs Office in January.\n\nBut it's likely China has not decided whether it would prefer a Biden or Trump presidency, wrote Yun Sun, a nonresident fellow at the Brookings Institution, on May 31.\n\nAfter all, Trump's first term saw his administration lifting US government rules restricting interactions between American and Taiwanese officials — a deepening of their relationship.\n\n\"China doesn't believe Trump wanted a war with China over Taiwan, but they do see his indulgence of his team on Taiwan as the result of his overall 'maximum pressure' campaign to force China to cave on other fronts, such as trade,\" wrote Sun.\n\nRead the original article on Business Insiderhttps://www.businessinsider.com/donald-trump-taiwan-took-chip-business-pay-us-protection-manufacturing-2024-7","feature_image":null,"featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"all","created_at":"2024-07-17 12:48:56","created_by":"1","updated_at":"2024-07-17 12:48:56","updated_by":null,"published_at":"2024-07-17 06:56:04","published_by":"1","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":"https://www.businessinsider.com/donald-trump-taiwan-took-chip-business-pay-us-protection-manufacturing-2024-7","newsletter_id":null,"show_title_and_feature_image":1},{"id":"6697d31010579c2fd4f6c303","uuid":"353e27ec-670a-4a76-8045-2bbcaf5cf0be","title":"Reality Star Savannah Chrisley Given Primetime RNC Slot to Attack the DOJ","slug":"reality-star-savannah-chrisley-given-primetime-rnc-slot-to-attack-the-doj-2","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"image\",{\"src\":\"https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_2088,w_3712,x_0,y_164/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1721170577/GettyImages-1992936481_1_hqbnfj\"}]],\"markups\":[],\"sections\":[[10,0]],\"ghostVersion\":\"3.0\"}","lexical":null,"html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_2088,w_3712,x_0,y_164/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1721170577/GettyImages-1992936481_1_hqbnfj\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\"></figure>","comment_id":"6697bdb8e27079000113c064","plaintext":null,"feature_image":null,"featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"all","created_at":"2024-07-17 12:48:56","created_by":"1","updated_at":"2024-07-17 12:48:56","updated_by":null,"published_at":"2024-07-16 23:49:53","published_by":"1","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":"https://www.thedailybeast.com/reality-star-savannah-chrisley-given-primetime-rnc-slot-to-attack-the-doj","newsletter_id":null,"show_title_and_feature_image":1},{"id":"6697d31010579c2fd4f6c304","uuid":"7905ec21-55fb-4dc5-be9b-6abf08c47742","title":"Trump is considering giving Jamie Dimon, who he once called a 'highly overrated globalist,' a prime Cabinet position","slug":"trump-is-considering-giving-jamie-dimon-who-he-once-called-a-highly-overrated-globalist-a-prime-cabinet-position","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"image\",{\"src\":\"https://i.insider.com/669736aa9caa6ed01e023847?width=1200&format=jpeg\"}],[\"image\",{\"src\":\"https://i.insider.com/669736448893442a5157356f?format=jpeg\",\"alt\":\"Jamie Dimon testifying during a Senate Banking Committee hearing;

The former president called Dimon a \"highly overrated globalist\" in a November Truth Social post.\n\n\"I've never been a big Jamie Dimon fan, but had to live with this guy when he came begging to the White House. I guess I don't have to live with him anymore, and that's a really good thing!\" Trump wrote in November.\n\nRight-wing figures use the word \"globalist\" to refer to a fringe conspiracy theory about a cabal of elite individuals secretly controlling the world. Trump has been known to use the term as an insult — he called his former protégé, Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida, a \"RINO globalist.\"\n\nBut it looks like Trump may be feeling differently about Dimon now.\n\nFor one, Haley is no longer a threat to Trump's presidential ambitions. The former South Carolina governor ended her presidential campaign in March and endorsed Trump at the Republican National Convention on Tuesday.\n\nDimon also softened his stance on Trump and praised the former president's policy record in January.\n\n\"He's kind of right about NATO. Kind of right about immigration,\" Dimon told CNBC at the World Economic Forum's annual meeting in Davos. \"He grew the economy quite well. Tax reform worked. He was right about some of China.\"\n\n\"I don't like how Trump said things, but he wasn't wrong about those critical issues. That's why they're voting for him. People should be more respectful of our fellow citizens,\" says @JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon. \"I think this negative talk about MAGA will hurt Biden's campaign.\" pic.twitter.com/WKnDjBvefOJanuary 17, 2024\n\nTo be sure, Dimon hasn't indicated that he plans to leave JPMorgan anytime soon. During the bank's investor day in May, Dimon said he intends to stay on for another three-and-a-half years, per Reuters.\n\nThat said, Dimon hasn't ruled out a career in politics entirely.\n\n\"Obviously, it's crossed my mind because people mention things to you and stuff like that. I love my country, and maybe one day I'll serve my country in one capacity or another,\" Dimon told Bloomberg TV in May.\n\nRepresentatives for Trump and Dimon didn't immediately respond to requests

This time, the deal that we're all stoked about is almost $150 off the Vitamix 5200, the hero deal of threads like this one and this one. It also happens to be our pick for the best blender after testing and consulting with nutritionists.\n\nHere are the best Amazon Prime Day deals on products that both we and Reddit recommend so you know you're only getting the best.\n\n\nTop 8 deals\n\n\nOur guides that feature these Amazon Prime Day deals\n\n * Best hair dryers\n * Best air fryers\n * Best Apple AirPods\n * Best Apple iPads\n *

only policies endorsed by President Trump for a second term, adding that \"Team Biden and the DNC are LYING and fear-mongering because they have NOTHING else to offer the American people.\"\n\nThough he denies knowing anything about the project, the playbook mentions Trump's name more than 300 times.\n\nKevin Roberts, the president of The Heritage Foundation, noted in a July 10 episode of \"The Vince Coglianese Show\" that there's a \"tremendous\" amount of overlap between Trump's Agenda 47 and Project 2025 — and the standard Republican platform more generally.\n\nRoberts said there were \"no hard feelings from any of us at Project 2025\" about Trump's statement denouncing their agenda, saying \"he's making a political tactical decision there\" in response to a swath of bad press about the playbook's extreme policies.\n\n\"I think what you're going to see is the beginning of a golden era of conservative reform,\" Roberts added. \"Not just because of President Trump, although he deserves most of the credit, but because the rest of the conservative movement has realized this is the moment if we have the leader and the plan that we're able to begin to undo all of the wreckage of the radical left of the last several decades.\"\n\nRead the original article on Business

United States, the Supreme Court did more than create criminal immunity for presidents. By defining a sacred zone of protection from criminal oversight for core presidential powers articulated in the Constitution, it also vastly expanded the dangers of a future criminal presidency.\n\nTucked among those core powers, Chief Justice John Roberts wrote for the majority, is the president’s power to grant “reprieves and pardons for offenses against the United States” — a presidential duty he characterized as having “unrivaled gravity and breath.” Roberts’s broad articulation of the pardon power is significant. Without it, a president’s ability to use the powers of the Oval Office to commit crimes with impunity might not work.\n\nThe majority’s distinction between official and unofficial acts has triggered broad public debate over how much criminal liability remains for presidents. But coupled with the pardon power, the common-sense answer is that there is none.\n\nUnder the decision, official acts get immunity, and unofficial acts do not. So imagine a president who pulls out a pistol from his personal belongings and shoots a person he dislikes. Under the majority’s reasoning, that would be an unofficial act, so he could be prosecuted for murder after leaving office.\n\nNo president would be so foolish as to do such a thing. He’d use his official powers to do it instead.\n\nImagine the same vindictive killing — one that’s concededly motivated by pure personal malice, with no bearing on the broader interests of the American public. This time, rather than use his personal handgun, the president directs a federal law enforcement officer to commit the murder for him with an official federal firearm. Under the majority’s reasoning, the Constitution would now forbid any legal consequences attaching to the president for having directed the same murder — even after he becomes a private citizen.\n\nYet as a practical matter, that murder can be carried out only if the law enforcement officer abides by the president’s directive. If she does, and is later prosecuted, the officer will not get immunity because she is not the president.\n\nSo the officer must make a choice — either do the criminal bidding of the president, refuse and lose her job or face the wrath of a criminally-minded president who might persuade another law enforcement officer to silence her. With no protection from a criminal indictment, she might say no, resign and go public with her story in order to protect herself from retaliation. (This hypothetical sets aside for the sake of argument the threat of state prosecutions.)\n\nEnter the pardon power. Armed with the language of the majority’s opinion in Trump v. U.S., such a president could promise the law enforcement officer a pardon, and perhaps a monetary bribe, to incentivize her to murder his rival under the guise of engaging in federal law enforcement activity within the president’s official power.\n\nCould this scheme work? The better answer, under the foundational structure of the Constitution, is “no.” Ours is a system of laws. The Revolutionary War was fought to escape the monarchy of King George III.\n\nRoberts’s opinion prompts the grave possibility that the answer could one day be “yes.”\n\nLike much of the Constitution, the language establishing the pardon power is vague. It doesn’t say, for example, whether “offenses” under Article II’s pardon power means a possible crime, a charged crime or a criminal conviction.\n\nArguably, under the previous hypothetical, the president’s promise of a pardon would mean nothing until the crime is actually committed. It turns out that in an 1866 case called Ex parte Garland, the Supreme Court stated that pardons of a federal offense “may be extended at any time after its commission.” So for the president’s murder scheme to work, the law enforcement officer would have to accept the risk that the president might not follow through on his promise of a pardon. A pardon issued for hypothetical crimes is meaningless (so much for the nearly universal adage that presidential pardons have no limits whatsoever).\n\nNow assume further that the law enforcement officer takes the chance and secures the pardon. Under the recent immunity ruling, evidence of the “official act” of the president’s pardon is now shielded, too. Without access to evidence bearing on how the president exercised his official power, the public might never even learn of the murder.\n\nRoberts also took pains to point out that “after the Watergate tapes revealed President Nixon’s misuse of official power to obstruct the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s investigation of the Watergate burglary, President Ford pardoned Nixon.” Ford’s pardon occurred before any charges were brought against Nixon. So although the Constitution does not specify whether an actual charge is a prerequisite to a pardon, the Nixon pardon arguably operates as historical precedent condoning pardons that preempt the criminal justice system altogether. The law enforcement officer who accepts a promise of a pardon can thus rest assured that history will likely insulate her from the whiff of an indictment.\n\nThe combination of presidential immunity and preemptive pardons becomes downright terrifying when the hypothetical is expanded to dozens, scores or even hundreds of federal law enforcement and military personnel. Imagine a criminal president who takes office and populates his cabinet and the lower-level executive ranks with people willing to engage in crimes in exchange for pardons and other perks. Under the Supreme Court’s stunning immunity opinion, the public would be largely helpless to respond, except by the unrealistic specter of impeachment.\n\nPerhaps this picture is too unrealistic and far-fetched to even worry about. The Supreme Court majority sidestepped the possibility that such a man will make it one day into the Oval Office.\n\nFor now, however, without any threat of criminal or civil liability looming over future presidents, the only thing standing in the way of an Oval Office crime spree is personal integrity — or his subordinates’ refusals to carry out his orders.\n\nKimberly Wehle is author of “How to Read the Constitution — and Why.” Her forthcoming book, “Pardon Power: How the Pardon System Works — and Why,” is out in September.","feature_image":null,"featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"all","created_at":"2024-07-17 14:19:04","created_by":"1","updated_at":"2024-07-17 14:19:04","updated_by":null,"published_at":"2024-07-17 13:19:51","published_by":"1","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":"https://thehill.com/opinion/judiciary/4776364-a-frightening-thought-experiment-a-murderous-president-with-criminal-immunity/","newsletter_id":null,"show_title_and_feature_image":1},{"id":"6697d31010579c2fd4f6c43d","uuid":"bae80cce-dbd3-4146-ab37-b409c0fb3e59","title":"Secret Service 'solely responsible' for Trump rally security design, implementation: Director","slug":"secret-service-solely-responsible-for-trump-rally-security-design-implementation-director","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[],\"markups\":[[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/16/politics/secret-service-director-interview/index.html\",\"rel\",\"noopener noreferrer\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4770665-timeline-of-trump-rally-shooting/\",\"rel\",\"noopener noreferrer\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://thehill.com/policy/national-security/4773893-secret-service-scrutiny-trump-assassination-attempt/\",\"rel\",\"noopener noreferrer\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4770615-trump-rally-shot-ear-post/\",\"rel\",\"noopener noreferrer\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4772390-trump-reflects-assassination-attempt/\",\"rel\",\"noopener noreferrer\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://thehill.com/policy/national-security/4776617-secret-service-director-assassination-attempt-roof/\",\"rel\",\"noopener noreferrer\"]]],\"sections\":[[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"U.S. Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle said in a \"],[0,[0],1,\"Tuesday interview\"],[0,[],0,\" that the agency is “solely responsible” for the plan and execution of security at the Pennsylvania rally where former President Trump \"],[0,[1],1,\"was shot\"],[0,[],0,\" over the weekend.\"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"“At that particular site, we divided up areas of responsibility, but the Secret Service is totally responsible for the design and implementation and the execution of the site,” Cheatle told CNN’s Whitney Wild Tuesday evening.\"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"Her comment comes \"],[0,[2],1,\"amid heightened scrutiny\"],[0,[],0,\" of the federal agency and its leadership, after a gunman’s \"],[0,[3],1,\"bullet grazed\"],[0,[],0,\" Trump’s ear, causing a bloody scene at a campaign event Saturday.

Phrases like “they tried to kill Trump” are already making the rounds — with \"they\" being the nebulous, esoteric entity that conspiracies often invoke.\n\nWhile we await more information on this assassination attempt, we shouldn’t entertain unfounded claims. ESuch speculation not only muddies the waters but also fuels a dangerous cycle of misinformation, paranoia and division.\n\nBefore addressing the formation of such conspiracy theories, it’s essential to grieve with those directly affected by this tragic event. The assassination attempt not only targeted a former president and current candidate, but it resulted in the death of at least one spectator. This loss of life is a somber reminder of the human cost behind political violence and irrationality.\n\nBut conspiracy theories only worsen this tragedy and increase irrationality.\n\nUnderstanding the “proportionality bias” — the inclination to believe that big events must stem from big causes — can prove helpful in understanding our susceptibility to conspiracy theories.\n\nWhen something as significant as an assassination attempt occurs, it seems too important to result solely from a lone, unhinged gunman. Instead, seeking comfort from the thought that our lives are not subject to such random events, the human mind gravitates toward the idea that a powerful, shadowy group must be responsible and that we are smart enough to discover it.\n\nTo understand this bias better, compare the conspiracy theories surrounding the assassination of President John F. Kennedy with those related to the attempted assassination of President Ronald Reagan.\n\nJFK’s assassination had profound consequences: an abrupt end of a presidency, a deep trauma inflicted on the nation and geopolitical implications during the height of the Cold War. Given these enormous consequences, countless conspiracy theories have flourished for decades, involving everyone from the Mafia to the CIA to foreign governments.\n\nIn contrast, when John Hinckley Jr. attempted to assassinate Ronald Reagan, the consequences were comparatively minor. Reagan survived, and despite the seriousness of the event, the nation quickly moved on. As a result, there are few conspiracy theories surrounding this incident.\n\nThe difference can be explained by proportionality bias: The greater the perceived impact of an event, the more likely people are to believe that it must have been caused by a significant, coordinated effort. Had Hinckley succeeded with his plans, you can bet the conspiracy theories would abound.\n\nThe same dynamic is now at play with the attempted assassination of Trump. But unlike during Hinckley’s attempted assassination, we now live in a 24-hour news cycle, and social media empowers everyone to share their opinions.\n\nMoreover, Trump is an atypical candidate, and this election has stoked atypical passions. As a result, many are already crafting elaborate and unfounded narratives because the event’s potential consequences are immense during this high-stakes election cycle.\n\nBut we should resist the urge to fill in the blanks with unfounded theories. Doing so distracts from the factual investigation that needs to take place and can lead to further societal division and distrust.\n\nAs Nobel laureate Daniel Kahneman stated, “We are prone to overestimate how much we understand about the world and to underestimate the role of chance in events.”\n\nIn times of growing distrust, the truth is often more mundane than the stories our minds create. And conspiracy theories do not aid our understanding of the situation. Instead, it increases the likelihood of a warped democracy and heightened irrationality.\n\nBy resisting the allure of conspiracy theories, we uphold the principles of rationality and truth — principles foundational to a healthy, functioning democracy. Our commitment to these principles is more important now than ever.\n\nGreg Osborne teaches legal ethics at the University of Utah’s S.J.

Michael Bennet, a Democrat, said in an interview on CNN last week that Trump “is on track, I think, to win this election, and maybe win it by a landslide and take with him the Senate and the House.”\n\nBillionaire investor Bill Ackman took to X late last month shortly after the 90-minute debate, which went dreadfully for the president, and declared, flatly, that Trump “is going to win in a landslide.”\n\nEven The New York Times noted in an analysis: “The word ‘landslide’ is now credibly being mentioned about Mr. Trump for the first time in his political career.”\n\nCredibly? Well, perhaps not.\n\nAmple reasons exist why a popular vote landslide is unlikely in 2024. Notable among those reasons is that the country is, and remains, sharply divided politically, which has led to a series of fairly close presidential elections and no true landslides in 40 years. Not since Ronald Reagan crushed Walter Mondale in a 49-state blowout in 1984 has a presidential candidate won election by at least 10 percentage points, the traditional standard for a landslide victory. Reagan won by 18 points.\n\nMany Americans, moreover, remain inclined — even keen — to vote against Trump in 2024. Before the attempted assassination, pollsters reported that the former president’s disapproval rating was above 50 percent, which certainly represents a constraint on building a popular-vote landslide. Another likely constraint is Trump’s choice for running mate, first-term Sen. JD Vance of Ohio. Vance is no moderate, and as such is unlikely to add substantially to Trump’s popular vote total.\n\nIn any event, summer can be a time when predictions or expectations of a “landslide” can take hold and multiply, only to fizzle in the weeks and months that follow.\n\nFour years ago, Trump’s ouster by landslide dimensions was much discussed by pundits. James Carville, a Democratic strategist, went on MSNBC in late June 2020 to declare Trump’s prospects for reelection so bleak that he ought to be advised to quit the campaign. Biden then led Trump by 10 points, according to polling averages compiled by RealClearPolitics.\n\n“There’s no chance he’s going to be reelected,” Carville asserted, adding that “somebody’s going to have to go tell this guy, ‘Look, you just can’t risk the humiliating defeat that’s going to come your way.’ ” The Republican Party, Carville said, “can’t continue in this direction. They have to think of something else.”\n\nAbout the same time, Josh Kraushaar wrote in the National Journal that it was “more likely that Biden will win a landslide victory...than it is that Trump can mount a miraculous turnaround in just over four months.” Kraushaar’s commentary carried the headline, “Prepare for a Biden landslide.”\n\nBiden defeated Trump in 2020 by 4.5 points — a clear victory, but hardly the landslide anticipated by pundits, or by late-campaign polls conducted for CNN and NBC News. They had pegged Biden’s lead at 12 and 10 points, respectively.\n\nPredictions of landslides were also frustrated in 2016, too, when Democrat Hillary Clinton was expected to defeat Trump handily. Jamelle Bouie wrote at Slate, “There is no horse race here. Clinton is far enough ahead, at a late enough stage in the election, that what we have is a horse running by itself, unperturbed but for the faint possibility of a comet hitting the track. Place your bets accordingly.” Clinton’s lead in the RealClearPolitics polling average was 5.4 points when Bouie’s commentary was posted in late summer 2016.\n\nIn the meantime, Bret Stephens, then of the Wall Street Journal, said on MSNBC that “a lot of people have no idea that Trump is headed for a historic defeat.” Trump narrowly lost the popular vote in 2016 but won the Electoral College and the presidency.\n\nPollster Elmo Roper announced in late summer 1948 that he would release no additional survey results about the race between President Harry Truman and Republican Thomas E. Dewey, so sure he was of Truman’s coming repudiation. Roper predicted Dewey would win “by a heavy margin,” saying opinion polling had “come of age and proved its accuracy and worth.”\n\nThose polls failed in epic fashion when Truman won a stunning upset.\n\nW.

The circumstances of this victory had as much to do with the corruption inside the city’s Democratic machine as anything else. The Brooklyn Dems were all tied up with the mob and that went public. The Queens Borough President offed himself when he got caught up in the investigations. So let’s just say that the city needed to run someone not connected with the Italian roots of the party. At the same time, the Supreme Court threw out the New York Board of Estimate, which had representatives from all the boroughs and which de facto governed the city. The Court threw it out based on the lack of proportional representation.\n\nThe larger point is that the city’s Democratic Party was a real mess in the late 80s and there was room for fresh blood to rise faster than they normally could have done. Dinkins was the winner of that.\n\nOr sort of. I say that because the real issue with Dinkins in our history is how horribly he was treated by the media and by the racism throughout New York City. Dinkins was a good mayor. New York in 1989 was not exactly a great place. Dinkins’ successor, the odious Rudy Giuliani, gets most of the credit for cleaning up New York, but Dinkins started almost all of this. The city’s high murder rate peaked in 1990 and began to decline from there. Dinkins increased police hiring by 25 percent and the murder rate declined 12 percent by 1993. But the perception was still there that crime had worsened under Dinkins and no amount of data was going to convince whites that crime wasn’t worse under the Black guy. Dinkins also cracked down on police violence the best he could, leading to tensions between him and the cops, who became big Giuliani guys since he was happy to let them beat and kill Black people all they wanted. The cops basically tried to ruin Dinkins and they mostly succeeded. In 1992, 4,000 off-duty cops held a protest closing Brooklyn Bridge against Dinkins’ attempt to hold them accountable. Naturally, the thugs turned violent and tried to rush City Hall, forcing cops more loyal to Dinkins or at least loyal to law and order to push back on the cops who didn’t care about law and order at all.\n\nI want to quote Steve’s (RIP) great post about whether recent NYC mayors were assholes or not. Here is what he said about Dinkins:\n\nDavid Dinkins (1990-1993):\n\nNew York City’s first black mayor, Dinkins reminds me a lot of John Lindsay, in the sense that his detractors were overwhelmingly motivated by racial animus refracted through the lens of policing. The fact that crime rates in NYC began to drop significantly during his tenure as mayor (well before Guiliani), or that he massively expanded the police force – none of that matters because he tried to make the Civilian Compliant Review Board legitimately civilian and independent of the NYPD.\n\nThat was enough to touch off a massive, and openly racist, police riot at City Hall, which Guiliani happily attended and stoked the flames of resentment against a black mayor who dared to tell the NYPD what to do.\n\nVerdict: not an asshole. Fuck the haters.\n\nThere’s no question that Dinkins had some rough stuff to deal with over his four years, as any city’s mayor would have to deal with. The Crown Heights Riot would have been hard for any mayor. But this was a New York filled with racial tensions. It was the Spike Lee New York of Do the Right Thing. Boycotts of Korean stores by Black customers or battles in the streets between Black and Orthodox Jewish New Yorkers is not something any mayor can magically alleviate.\n\nIt was also Dinkins who started cleaning up Times Square and he got Disney to put money into the Amsterdam Theatre to become the area’s centerpiece, friendly for tourists. He put together the lease to the US Tennis Association to create the modern facilities of the U.S. Open, which is one of the few deals between cities and sports leagues that worked out for the city.\n\nCan we talk about why we think New York is some kind of liberal city? Because I see nothing to support this. They elect terrible mayor after terrible mayor, usually in the asshole mode, as Steve pointed out. The election of Giuliani was pure white ethnic backlash politics against the Black guy, showing how Democratic bases would later abandon the party for Donald Trump after another Black guy got elected. As far as I can tell, New York voters are largely horrible and they have hurt the nation a lot through their mayors, most especially Giuliani, but also Bloomberg and Adams. One thing I can say pretty strongly is that Dinkins is the best New York mayor of my lifetime.\n\nAfter he left the mayoral office, Dinkins taught at Columbia’s School of International and Public Affairs and did all the elite corporate and charity board stuff that retired politicians do.\n\nA word as well as about Dinkins’ wife Joyce. They married in 1953 and so had a very long life together. In addition to raising their children, she was an active political animal as well. As first lady of the city, she did a lot of work on child literacy and healthcare issues. Before that though, she was coordinator of metropolitan affairs for the New York State Department of Taxation and Finance. She left that job when her husband became mayor.\n\nDinkins died in 2020, a month after Joyce. He was 93 years old.\n\nDavid Dinkins is buried in Cathedral Church of St. John the Divine, Manhattan, New York.\n\nIf you would like this series to visit other mayors of the 1980s, you can donate to cover the required expenses here.

In 2020, those elites spent even more to defeat Trump. The few who supported Trump that year — such as venture capitalist Peter Thiel, the co-founder of Paypal and Palantir — did so knowing they were standing on a third rail, and many did not speak openly about it for fear of backlash that could hurt their businesses.\n\nSomething has changed since the last election cycle.\n\nThis week, the Wall Street Journal reported that Elon Musk, who endorsed Trump Saturday after the assassination attempt against him, planned to send $45 million a month to a pro-Trump super PAC starting in July. (Musk appeared to push back on the reporting with a meme on X reading: “FAKE GNUS.”)\n\nThe prominent tech investor and entrepreneur David Sacks — who previously said that Trump should be disqualified from office for his actions surrounding the January 6, 2021, insurrection at the US Capitol — has now endorsed the former president. Sacks gave a speech at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee on Monday.\n\nOne of Silicon Valley’s largest venture capital firms, Andreessen Horowitz, has also recently indicated that it will donate large amounts to PACs supporting Trump.\n\n“The Blue Wall of tech is crumbling before our very eyes,” Ryan Selkis, the founder and CEO of the crypto research firm Messari, wrote on X last month.\n\nSelkis’s assessment might not be entirely true. By most indications, Silicon Valley is still overwhelmingly Democratic. But tech elites who are supporting Trump seem to be more comfortable doing so openly and without fear of being ostracized for it.\n\n\nWhy some Silicon Valley leaders are backing Trump\n\nSilicon Valley is not undergoing a seismic rightward shift.\n\nAs of 2022, a little over half of voters in San Mateo and Santa Clara counties (which encompass Silicon Valley) were registered Democrats. That share hasn’t changed much since the 1970s. The share of voters with no party preference has increased, while the share of Republican voters shrank to about 15 percent in 2022.\n\nSilicon Valley venture capitalists also seem to be supporting Democrats at a higher-than-average rate compared to the last 10 election cycles. A recent Wired analysis found that Democrats received $2 for every dollar that Republicans received from the 20 firms that, together with their employees, made the most political contributions.\n\nThat suggests Silicon Valley’s political views are still largely consistent with a 2017 study indicating that wealthy technologists supported many liberal policies: redistribution of wealth, abortion, gay rights, immigration, and more.\n\nBut there was one issue on which, even in 2017, they chafed with Democrats: They didn’t want the government to interfere in the operation of their businesses. And that might be driving at least some of the support for Trump among Silicon Valley elites this election cycle.\n\nPresident Joe Biden has taken a hardline approach against Big Tech that might be perceived by some donors as overreach. The administration has filed sweeping antitrust lawsuits against four major tech companies: Apple, Google (now known as Alphabet), Meta, and Amazon.\n\nSince the downfall of the crypto exchange FTX and its founder Sam Bankman-Fried, the Biden administration has also cracked down on crypto, filing lawsuits against Coinbase and Binance and trying to advance more stringent regulation.\n\nTrump’s new running mate, J.D. Vance, seems to broadly share the Biden administration’s philosophy: he has applauded Lina Khan, the head of the Federal Trade Commission behind the antitrust suits against Big Tech. It’s not clear whether he will temper that position now that he’s running for vice president, but some tech titans seem to be supporting the Republican ticket anyway.\n\nAndreessen Horowitz had previously suggested that government regulation would determine which party receives their dollars. “We are non-partisan, one-issue voters: If a candidate supports an optimistic technology-enabled future, we are for them. If they want to choke off important technologies, we are against them,” the firm announced in December.\n\nIn a video posted on Tuesday, founders Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz further explained why their firm would be supporting Trump.\n\n“The future of our business, the future of … new technology, and the future of America is literally at stake,” Horowitz said, acknowledging that he would be angering friends and family. “We think Donald Trump is actually the right choice.”\n\nCrypto leaders, who have for years poured money into the fight against further regulation of the industry, have also contributed more heavily to Republicans. The crypto PAC Stand With Crypto has not issued an endorsement in the presidential race but has identified Trump and Robert F. Kennedy as better options than Biden.\n\nBeyond regulation, it seems that some Silicon Valley billionaires are becoming more vocal in their support of Trump just because they can without suffering boycotts or lots of bad press. For instance, Musk has always been a bit of a contrarian but seems to have taken on a more politically active presence online since he bought Twitter and renamed it X. And while his stance may have cost him users and advertisers early in his X tenure, his endorsement of Trump has yet to be met with a similar backlash.\n\n\nBiden is on the back foot on fundraising\n\nThe support Trump is receiving from a few wealthy patrons in Silicon Valley should nevertheless worry the Biden campaign.\n\nAs of the last campaign finance reports through the end of May, Trump had surpassed Biden in cash on hand. Trump had $116.6 million in his campaign coffers compared to Biden’s $91.6 million.\n\nThat advantage has likely only grown in the months since. Biden has reportedly struggled with fundraising since his disastrous debate performance last month. Some donors think he should drop out and have promised to suspend donations to Democrats until he does so; others have paused contributions while they wait for assurance that he will not be replaced with another Democratic candidate.\n\nTrump, meanwhile, has started fundraising off of the assassination attempt against him. His campaign website redirected to a photo of him punching the air with blood on his face at the campaign rally where he was shot in the ear.\n\nIf Musk is indeed planning to contribute tens of millions to Trump’s campaign monthly through the election, it’s hard to see how Biden can keep up.","feature_image":null,"featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"all","created_at":"2024-07-17 14:19:07","created_by":"1","updated_at":"2024-07-17 14:19:07","updated_by":null,"published_at":"2024-07-17 10:30:00","published_by":"1","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":"https://www.vox.com/politics/361087/trump-silicon-valley-fundraising-musk-andreessen-horowitz","newsletter_id":null,"show_title_and_feature_image":1},{"id":"6697d31010579c2fd4f6c44f","uuid":"5b3ea154-922a-457d-9590-157c9f18768e","title":"What so many high-profile shootings have in common","slug":"what-so-many-high-profile-shootings-have-in-common","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"image\",{\"src\":\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/GettyImages-2161607020.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0,0,100,100\",\"caption\":\"\"}]],\"markups\":[[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://www.vox.com/politics/360390/trump-shot-assassination-attempt-shooter-bullet-butler-pennsylvania-biden-secret-service-updates\",\"rel\",\"noopener noreferrer\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://www.npr.org/2021/03/27/981803154/why-nearly-all-mass-shooters-are-men\",\"rel\",\"noopener noreferrer\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://www.vox.com/23142734/kansas-city-superbowl-mass-shooting\",\"rel\",\"noopener noreferrer\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://www.chalkbeat.org/2024/07/16/after-school-shootings-attempted-trump-assassination-teens-live-in-fear/\",\"rel\",\"noopener noreferrer\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/02/us/elliot-rodger-killings-in-california-followed-years-of-withdrawal.html\",\"rel\",\"noopener noreferrer\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/02/us/dylann-roof-charleston-killing-mental.html\",\"rel\",\"noopener noreferrer\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://apnews.com/article/religion-shootings-race-and-ethnicity-racial-injustice-dylann-roof-9b83ed2ecca145ffa546746dd704a092\",\"rel\",\"noopener noreferrer\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2022/06/03/why-so-many-mass-shooters-young-angry-men/\",\"rel\",\"noopener noreferrer\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/02/us/politics/mass-shootings-young-men-guns.html\",\"rel\",\"noopener noreferrer\"]],[\"em\"],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/13/magazine/robert-putnam-interview.html\",\"rel\",\"noopener noreferrer\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/2019/4/16/18287446/incel-definition-reddit\",\"rel\",\"noopener noreferrer\"]],[\"strong\"],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/406238/stark-gender-gap-gun-ownership-views-gun-laws.aspx\",\"rel\",\"noopener noreferrer\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://ojjdp.ojp.gov/statistical-briefing-book/offending-by-youth/faqs/qa03504\",\"rel\",\"noopener noreferrer\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://www.businessinsider.com/heres-how-guns-are-advertised-in-america-2012-12#adam-lanza-brandished-a-bushmaster-ar-15-when-he-murdered-27-women-and-small-children-in-newtown-this-is-how-that-weapon-is-marketing-to-the-general-public-magazine-ads-equate-owning-the-gun-to-being-a-man-1\",\"rel\",\"noopener noreferrer\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://www.vox.com/scotus/24151144/supreme-court-worst-decisions-donald-trump\",\"rel\",\"noopener noreferrer\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://www.thetrace.org/2023/03/guns-america-data-atf-total/\",\"rel\",\"noopener noreferrer\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://www.americanprogress.org/article/fact-sheet-weakening-requirements-to-carry-a-concealed-firearm-increases-violent-crime/\",\"rel\",\"noopener noreferrer\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://www.levernews.com/pennsylvania-gop-fought-a-ban-on-the-gun-used-in-trump-shooting/\",\"rel\",\"noopener noreferrer\"]]],\"sections\":[[10,0],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"We don’t know much yet about the \"],[0,[0],1,\"shooter\"],[0,[],0,\" who killed one man and wounded two others in an apparent assassination attempt on Donald Trump on Saturday.\"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"We do know that he was 20 years old, and male.\"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"Those two facts — and his role in Saturday’s shocking crimes — put him in a small but frightening group: He’s now among a handful of young American men who, driven by psychological distress, hatred, or something else, commit highly public acts of violence with powerful guns.\"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"He joins a list of young men that includes the two high school seniors who killed 13 people at Columbine High School in 1999;

Fearing the Allied advance, SS soldiers moved Rubin and 1,620 others to Buchenwald, a concentration camp in central Germany, and from there on a death march south into Bavaria.</p><p>After about two days of torture, they entered a small town outside Munich called Ergoldsbach. A group of regular German army soldiers were in the town, lounging in the street with their vehicles. Rubin yelled, “Look, look!” to create a distraction, and quickly slid under a tank. He stayed there until the SS guards had gone.</p><p>For the next two weeks, Rubin lived on scraps scrounged up by a friendly Polish worker; at one point, he hid from German soldiers in a pile of dry dung on a local farm. When the American army liberated the town at the end of the month, a soldier from Chicago found him lying in a street, unable to move his legs. Seeing Rubin’s Auschwitz tattoo on his arm, the soldier carried him to a hospital and ordered the Germans to take care of him.</p><p>Once he recovered, Rubin became the leader of the small community of Jewish survivors stranded in Ergoldsbach. He met an American who worked for the US government’s refugee aid branch. The American tracked down a cousin of Rubin’s in the United States, a connection that eventually helped Rubin get permission to immigrate. About four years later, he and his new wife, Anita, also a Holocaust survivor, crossed the Atlantic. They settled near David’s family in Philadelphia, where their child was born — my mother, Ruth.</p><p>I learned the details of David’s extraordinary story in 2011, six years after his death, thanks to a German scholar named Gerhard Strasser. Strasser had been working with residents of Ergoldsbach to document the history of the town during the Holocaust and invited our family to attend a ceremony presenting some of the findings. What I remember from that trip, more than anything else, are the children.</p><p>Students at a local school had been assigned projects on Ergoldsbach’s Holocaust history, including researching and writing short presentations on Jewish survivors. This wasn’t just a normal school assignment; people from around the town came to watch their children recite stories of what had happened. In the audience, I waited anxiously to hear my grandfather’s name. Eventually, a German child stood up and told the class about David Rubin’s improbable survival and rise to leadership among the survivors.</p><p>This was not merely a commemoration; it was repentance. In Ergoldsbach, I felt the weight Germans had put on themselves — and felt moved, as a Jew, that they still cared.</p><p>While Americans have long clashed over our country’s cruel and bigoted past, Germans have undertaken one of the most thoroughgoing efforts of any nation on the planet to reckon with their history. Germany, perhaps more than any other country, has attempted to pull out by the roots its homegrown variant of the reactionary spirit — the tendency of opponents of social change to choose hierarchy over democracy, trying to constrain or even topple democracy to protect hierarchies of wealth and status.</p><p>The Nazis were born out of disgust with post-World War I Weimar democracy, led by men furious about both the new government’s weakness and acceptance of the Jewish minority into German society. After Nazism brought Germany to ruin, preventing a reactionary resurgence became one of the central goals of the country’s subsequent leaders.</p><p>So it’s all the more extraordinary that in the past few years, Germany’s far right has been on the rise.</p><p>In 2015, at the peak of the global refugee crisis, German chancellor Angela Merkel announced an open-door policy for those fleeing violence in Syria and elsewhere. In response, the Alternative for Deutschland (AfD) party, a Euroskeptic faction without a single seat in Parliament, morphed into a virulently xenophobic force calling for Germany to slam Merkel’s open door shut.</p><p>In 2017’s national elections, AfD won 94 seats in the Bundestag, turning it into Germany’s third-largest political party.</p><p>Opposing the country’s approach to the migration policy did not, in and of itself, make AfD a threat to German democracy. But over time the party’s behavior has become more and more troubling.</p><p>In 2020, AfD supporters participated in an attempted storming of the German capitol building, the Bundestag, in a protest over Covid-19 restrictions. In December 2022, German police busted an armed cell that was plotting to forcibly install a minor noble as Germany’s new kaiser. One of the coup plotters was a former AfD member of Parliament who was serving in a minor party leadership role at the time of her arrest.</p><p>In February 2023, the executive vice president of the International Auschwitz Committee — a Berlin-based anti-hate group founded by Holocaust survivors — compared the party to the Nazis.</p><p>Yet AfD’s rise has continued.

In response, the Alternative for Deutschland (AfD) party, a Euroskeptic faction without a single seat in Parliament, morphed into a virulently xenophobic force calling for Germany to slam Merkel’s open door shut.\n\nIn 2017’s national elections, AfD won 94 seats in the Bundestag, turning it into Germany’s third-largest political party.\n\nOpposing the country’s approach to the migration policy did not, in and of itself, make AfD a threat to German democracy. But over time the party’s behavior has become more and more troubling.\n\nIn 2020, AfD supporters participated in an attempted storming of the German capitol building, the Bundestag, in a protest over Covid-19 restrictions. In December 2022, German police busted an armed cell that was plotting to forcibly install a minor noble as Germany’s new kaiser. One of the coup plotters was a former AfD member of Parliament who was serving in a minor party leadership role at the time of her arrest.\n\nIn February 2023, the executive vice president of the International Auschwitz Committee — a Berlin-based anti-hate group founded by Holocaust survivors — compared the party to the Nazis.\n\nYet AfD’s rise has continued. Politico Europe’s average of German polls shows that, between July 2022 and 2023, the party’s nationwide support nearly doubled — going from 11 percent to 20 percent. By early 2024, AfD was solidly the second-most popular party in Germany; it won a new record vote share in June’s European Parliament election.\n\nThe threat AfD poses to German democracy is, at least to some extent, contained by the German multiparty system, in which every mainstream party has so far refused to consider forming a national governing coalition with the AfD.\n\nBut its rise illustrates something vitally important: That Germany, of all countries, could fail to prevent a surge in reactionary antidemocratic politics suggests there’s something eternal and enduring about the reactionary spirit. And there is something about our current time period that makes it especially likely to flourish — not just in Germany, but around the world.\n\nPolitical scientists often separate the rise of democracy into three broad waves.\n\nThe first dates from the early 19th century to the years immediately following World War I. The second begins immediately after World War II, defined by the rebirth of democracy in western Europe and its emergence in a handful of postcolonial states.\n\nThis would soon be eclipsed by a massive third wave beginning in the 1970s and lasting for somewhere around 40 years. During this period, dictatorships of both the right and the left fell almost everywhere: Latin America, East Asia, sub-Saharan Africa, and the Eurasian countries of the former Eastern Bloc. By the turn of the century, roughly half of all countries around the world were democracies.\n\nDemocracy seems so normal, from a contemporary perspective, that it’s easy to lose sight of just how stunning this transformation was. Some variant of authoritarianism has been the default setting of human government for thousands of years. But in a little more than half a century, democracy went from nearly extinct — just 12 democracies survived the Second World War — to globally dominant. No single political system had ever conquered the entire planet so rapidly or so thoroughly.\n\nAfter the Berlin Wall fell in 1989, it appeared that the 20th-century triumph of democracy was complete. Having defeated fascism, its rival on the right, and communism, its rival on the left, Western-style liberal democracy truly faced no challenger. Its spread around the globe seemed assured.\n\nAnd for a few years, it was. The 1990s saw some of the most significant activity of democracy’s third wave, including across nearly all of Eastern Europe. Former communist states and Soviet republics — like Czechia, Hungary, and Estonia—democratized with remarkable speed. In some countries, the new democratic systems appeared to be fully stable in less than a decade.\n\nIn ideological terms, the world appeared mostly Americanized in the sense that democracy was the barely contested benchmark by which governments were measured. Culturally and locally specific antidemocratic ideologies remained influential in countries like China and Iran. But those governments did not present any kind of plausible or attractive alternative vision for most people around the world. On the whole, the language of democracy — human rights, elections, free speech, individual autonomy — became the assumed argot of global politics.\n\nIt was during this time that the phrase “end of history” entered the lexicon, thanks to a 1989 essay and subsequent book by political theorist Francis Fukuyama. Fukuyama argued that liberal democracy was the ultimate stage in the evolution of society. Fundamental forces in history, including deep human desires for recognition and equality, had buoyed it to global dominance.\n\nFukuyama did not claim that this state of affairs would necessarily last forever. Instead, he predicted, the very triumph of the system contained the seeds of a future crisis. “No regime — no ‘socioeconomic system’ — is able to satisfy all men in all places. This includes liberal democracy,” he wrote in the book. “Dissatisfaction arises precisely where democracy has triumphed most completely: it is a dissatisfaction with liberty and equality. Thus those who remain dissatisfied will always have the potential to restart history.”\n\nSome of this “dissatisfaction” was visible soon after the Cold War’s end.\n\nIn the 1990s, the far right began making its presence felt in a handful of European elections: Austria’s Freedom Party even entered a governing coalition in 2000 after a strong showing in the 1999 election. The 2000s and early 2010s saw varying signs of antidemocratic activity in consolidated democracies, from both the religious right (Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s consolidation of power in Turkey) and the socialist left (Hugo Chavez’s attack on democracy in Venezuela).\n\nBut as the 2010s wore on, it became clear that something new was happening on the right across advanced democracies. The reactionary right had risen to power in the United States, Hungary, Israel, India, Brazil, and Poland. Extreme-right western European parties — some of which, like Germany’s AfD, had a tenuous relationship at best with democracy — enjoyed an unprecedented wave of electoral success, winning larger seat shares in Parliaments and joining governing coalitions in larger numbers.\n\nEvery one of these new authoritarian movements presented itself as deeply and authentically democratic. While the parties openly attacked democracy-adjacent values — like liberalism, multiculturalism, or secularism — they all insisted that they supported the basic ideas of popular sovereignty and elections.\n\nThis strategy reflected the enduring global democratic consensus: A 2017 Pew survey of people in 38 countries found that huge majorities, a country median of 78 percent, believed that “a democratic system where representatives elected by citizens decide what becomes law” was a good way to run a country. Recognizing this reality, autocrats around the world began singing a more democratic tune.\n\nIn their 2022 book Spin Dictators, political scientists Sergei Guriev and Daniel Treisman quantitatively documented a transformation in global authoritarianism: a movement away from overt violent repression and toward manufacturing consent through ersatz elections and a managed press.\n\nGuriev and Treisman noted that this trend had even touched countries like Russia and Singapore, where public support for democracy as a governing system is far weaker than it is in the United States or western Europe. This, they argued, has a lot to do with democracy’s post-20th-century ideological dominance: On an interconnected planet where large portions of the world’s governments and citizens take democratic ideals seriously, even the most hardened authoritarian can face tangible consequences for open crackdowns on rights and freedoms.\n\nThe result was that political movements everywhere, but especially ones in seemingly consolidated democracies, had powerful incentives to develop a democratic-sounding justification for their actions — to Americanize their politics. By identifying domestic “enemies” that stood in for unwanted social change, they learned to galvanize a chunk of the public against those enemies in the name of protecting the homogeneous majority — an ironically universal playbook for antidemocratic success.\n\nWhile studying the rhetoric of these new authoritarian movements helps explain how they appealed to a mass audience, it doesn’t explain why people were especially attracted to their political vision today.\n\nThe theory of the reactionary spirit helps us understand this phenomenon.\n\nAs democracy’s reach expanded across the globe, so, too, did political contests over inequality. That competition, one way or another, brought tensions over status and identity to the fore of the political conversation — ideal circumstances for the reactionary spirit to threaten democracies old and new.\n\nThis is the underlying structural reality that helped the authoritarian right break through in country after country. Under such conditions, all it would take to start a reactionary fire was some kind of spark: an external shock, a high-visibility left-wing push for social change, canny leadership on the reactionary side, or some combination of all three (as in the United States in the post-Obama era). The 2010s saw a series of such trigger events around the world: decades of democratic expansion and evolving reactionary responses leading to a simultaneous surge in support for reactionary factions.\n\nIn Europe, the 2015 refugee crisis played a central role in the story. That year, violent bloodshed in countries like Syria and Afghanistan produced the single greatest number of refugees since World War II, many of whom fled to Europe seeking a better life. The centrist European establishment, led by German chancellor Angela Merkel, chose to welcome them, creating an opportunity for far-right parties to increase their support among Europeans uncomfortable with a massive influx of people who looked different, prayed differently, and spoke different languages.\n\nThe effect was swift and striking: Data from The PopuList, which catalogs far-right electoral support in European elections since 1989, shows a spike in these factions’ support around the continent in the wake of the crisis.\n\nBroadly speaking, the evidence suggests that European resentment toward immigration is rooted in concerns about changes to Europe’s traditional ethnic composition and hierarchy. A 2007 study that examined 20 European countries and over 38,000 individuals found that negative attitudes about multiculturalism were by far the best predictor of individual opposition to immigration. Many other factors, like a country’s unemployment level or a person’s individual income, had a negligible effect.\n\nThis underlying hostility toward cultural difference created fertile grounds for far-right parties to profit from a sudden spike in immigrant numbers, especially since many immigrants came from nonwhite Muslim countries.\n\nA 2018 paper by two German political scientists, Matthias Mader and Harald Schoen, examined a survey that asked the same group of people their opinions on elections and immigration before and after the refugee crisis. They found that attitudes on immigration, on the whole, hadn’t changed much: The same people who disliked immigration before the crisis still did afterward. But their partisan allegiances had shifted dramatically; anti-immigrant voters who had supported Merkel’s CDU defected to the AfD in significant numbers.\n\nThis is the reactionary spirit in action. The refugee crisis heightened the stakes for culturally conservative voters, forcing them to choose between centrist parties that were more welcoming to migrants and potentially antidemocratic extremists who opposed it. Many of them chose the latter, prioritizing preserving the traditional white-dominant society over protecting their democracy.\n\nAcross Europe, far-right parties started to reap electoral dividends. In Hungary in particular, the surge in power of anti-immigrant politics allowed a government that had already moved in an authoritarian direction to push a new and potent propaganda line, harnessing the reactionary spirit to consolidate its hold on power.\n\nSimilar events took place outside Europe. Post-Cold War Israel went through multidecade struggles over its ethnoreligious identity and occupation of Palestinian land, ultimately creating conditions for the reactionary spirit to spread from a small handful of extremists to a significant portion of the population. In India, the reactionary right’s rise began with a staged crisis designed to bring out the Hindu majority’s unease with India’s vision of equality.\n\nFukuyama’s warning has proved prescient. Frustration with the dominant era of equality and liberal rights has kept history going, with the reactionary spirit threatening democracy even in its strongholds.","feature_image":null,"featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"all","created_at":"2024-07-17 14:19:07","created_by":"1","updated_at":"2024-07-17 14:19:07","updated_by":null,"published_at":"2024-07-17 10:00:00","published_by":"1","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":"https://www.vox.com/politics/361136/far-right-authoritarianism-germany-reactionary-spirit","newsletter_id":null,"show_title_and_feature_image":1},{"id":"6697d31010579c2fd4f6c451","uuid":"cd91f363-0bd3-4c61-8fe2-474d1d8cbe3f","title":"Biden Confronts Voter Disenchantment as He Courts Latino Voters at Las Vegas Conference","slug":"biden-confronts-voter-disenchantment-as-he-courts-latino-voters-at-las-vegas-conference","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"image\",{\"src\":\"https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/AP24198859237465.jpg\",\"alt\":\"Election 2024 Biden\"}]],\"markups\":[],\"sections\":[[10,0],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"LAS VEGAS — President Joe Biden is trying to shore up support among disenchanted voters key to his reelection chances as he meets Wednesday with members of a Latino civil rights organization in the battleground state of Nevada.\"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"Biden is set to deliver an address to the UnidosUS annual conference in Las Vegas, where he’ll announce that beginning Aug. 19 certain U.S. citizens’ spouses without legal status can begin applying for permanent residency and eventually citizenship without having to first depart the country, according to the White House.

Other buzzy players include Applied Intuition, Capella Space, Epirus, Scale AI and Shield AI. Here's a look what they have cooking:\n\n * The Air Force in April selected Anduril and General Atomics to work on robo-wingmen known as collaborative combat aircraft. The two bested defense behemoths Boeing, Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman.\n * The Army in May awarded Palantir a $480 million deal to expand access to software that streamlines a deluge of battlefield information. The company topped RTX, formerly Raytheon, for a $178 million Tactical Intelligence Targeting Access Node contract, as well.\n * SpaceX hoists clandestine payloads and is also building a network of \"hundreds of spy satellites under a classified contract with a U.S. intelligence agency,\" Reuters reported.\n * Capella builds and operates synthetic aperture radar satellites that render Earth, even in adverse weather conditions. It now works closely with the intelligence community, and recently automated vessel detection and classification in its images.\n * Epirus wrapped delivery of four directed-energy drone zappers earlier this year, satisfying a $66 million deal with the Army. It's also eyeing naval applications, to fend off attacks similar to those being launched by Houthi rebels in Yemen.\n * Shield AI's digital pilot has been folded into several types of aircraft, with plans to expand to \"every aircraft under the sun.\" The Coast Guard tapped the company this month for a drone-surveillance contract worth up to $198 million.\n\nThis revolution is driven by software and private-sector aptitude to build equipment before the military knows it even needs it.\n\n * \"The long and the short of it is: Behaviors are changing,\" Jason Brown, Applied Intuition Defense's general manager, told Axios. \"There's no comparison between what existed before 1995, let's say, and today.\"\n * \"Software and data are now, really, the weapons that matter most,\" he said. \"A lot of people don't consider them weapons, but I think that's shortsighted.\"\n\nBy the numbers: Over the past three decades the Pentagon's contracting Rolodex shrank from 51 to five in aerospace and defense primes, or companies that maintain long-term and high-dollar relationships with the government.\n\n * Tactical missile suppliers dropped from 13 to three, fixed-wing aircraft suppliers declined from eight to three and satellite suppliers halved from eight to four, according to the 2022 assessment.\n * And large, established defense contractors still play a pivotal role in some of the most complex projects: aircraft carriers, stealth aircraft, tanks.\n\nSuch massive undertakings \"are not going away,\" according to Mike Brown, the former head of the Defense Innovation Unit now with Shield Capital.

But business travel — a hugely important revenue source for airlines, hotels and so on — has taken longer to rebound as Zoom replaced some handshake meetings.\n\nDriving the news: Nearly 3 in 4 corporate travel managers expect their company's business trip spending to grow this year, while 58% expect growth in 2025, per a new Deloitte study.\n\n * Those managers predict around 15% spending growth in each year.\n\nFriction point: At least some of that increased spending is being driven by higher travel prices.\n\n * Half of travel managers are pushing or requiring workers to book cheaper flights to save money, Deloitte found, while 38% are doing the same for hotels.\n\nYes, but: Trip frequency is also up, with 20% of business travelers expecting to take 6-10 trips this year, compared to 15% in 2023.\n\nZoom in: Broadly speaking, business travelers say they're taking fewer trips to meet with clients or prospective clients about projects.\n\n * Instead, conferences and trade shows are a big draw, with more than 6 in 10 business travelers planning to attend at least one this year, the report finds.\n\nThe intrigue: Business trips aren't always just business trips.\n\n * Business travelers love tacking on some personal time while they're away for work, with two-thirds saying they extended a business trip for leisure at least once last year, and 1 in 7 saying they did so at least three times.\n * And the vast majority — 83% — of business travelers say their trips are \"enjoyable,\" compared to 3% who dislike them.\n\nBetween the lines: The biz travel life ain't all rosy.\n\n * 55% of corporate jet-setters griped about general fatigue, 41% about time away from their family or significant others, and 39% about the ever-increasing stack of work looming back at

America Wealthy Once Again. Make America Safe Once Again. Make America Strong Once Again. And Make America Great Once Again.\n\nWhy it matters: Taking a lesson from their disappointing 2022 midterms, top Republicans are intent on running a campaign centered on this election, not the last one. But the ghosts of 2020 — and of Jan. 6 — are everywhere.\n\nThe big picture: At Donald Trump's Republican National Convention, acknowledging \"election irregularities\" in 2020 is the minimum bar for entry.\n\n * Sen. J.D. Vance (R-Ohio), Trump's new running mate, has said he would not have certified the 2020 election had he been vice president on Jan. 6, 2021, instead of Mike Pence.\n * Jan. 6 protesters and fake electors are among those serving as delegates at the RNC, including Nevada GOP chair Michael McDonald, who seconded Trump's official nomination on Monday.\n * Some of those electors have been indicted for their role in the 2020 scheme to overturn the election, including three Arizona delegates who requested permission to attend the convention as they await trial.\n\nDriving the news: Donald Trump Jr. offered a telling response when asked by Axios' Mike Allen on Tuesday under what scenario his father could lose to President Biden in November: \"I'd say cheating.\"\n\n * Echoing the former president's false claims about voter fraud, Trump Jr. mocked the idea that 2020 was the \"freest and fairest election ever\" and warned there are \"no lengths\" Democrats won't go to win.\n * \"We have to keep our foot on the gas every second of the day until Nov. 5, or — as it goes lately — Nov. 20 or Jan. 20, whatever,\" Trump Jr. said at Axios House in Milwaukee.\n\nZoom in: Arizona's Kari Lake — one of the country's leading election deniers — won a huge ovation as she kicked off a lineup of Senate candidates speaking on night two of the RNC.\n\n * Lake has tried to steer clear of rehashing her conspiracy theories on the campaign trail and did not reference the 2020 election in her convention speech.\n * But the MAGA favorite hasn't given up on her fraud obsession — and just last week asked Arizona's Supreme Court to overturn her loss in the 2022 gubernatorial election, even as she runs for Senate.\n\nOther prominent election deniers who spoke on Tuesday include House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-Ohio), House GOP conference chair Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.) and Ohio Senate candidate Bernie Moreno.\n\nBetween the lines: One famous RNC attendee who didn't get a speaking slot this year is Trump's former lawyer Rudy Giuliani, who faces financial ruin and multiple indictments for his post-2020 election activities.\n\n * On the convention floor Tuesday, Giuliani told CNN that he has \"no regrets\" about defaming two Georgia election workers, to whom he was ordered to pay $148 million in damages.\n\nThe bottom line: In a pre-recorded video broadcast to the convention hall Tuesday night, Trump punctured any notion that his GOP was moving on from 2020.\n\n * \"We never want what happened in 2020 to happen again,\" Trump said, making an aggressive appeal for Republicans to \"protect the vote\" by turning out in massive numbers.\n * \"Keep your eyes open, because these people want to cheat and they do cheat, and frankly it's the only thing they do well.\"","feature_image":null,"featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"all","created_at":"2024-07-17 14:19:12","created_by":"1","updated_at":"2024-07-17 14:19:12","updated_by":null,"published_at":"2024-07-17 08:30:00","published_by":"1","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":"https://www.axios.com/2024/07/17/trump-rnc-2020-election-denial-january-6","newsletter_id":null,"show_title_and_feature_image":1},{"id":"6697d31010579c2fd4f6c477","uuid":"f37b900a-98cf-4bf8-878a-1b16361edaee","title":"Trump rivals' night: 4 takeaways from Tuesday at the RNC","slug":"trump-rivals-night-4-takeaways-from-tuesday-at-the-rnc","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[],\"markups\":[[\"strong\"]],\"sections\":[[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"The theme of the night was \\\"Make America Safe Again,\\\" a focus on crime and border security.

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.).\n\nBiden's chosen leadership at the Democratic National Committee also is pushing to use an electronic roll call to lock him in as the party's presidential nominee weeks before its convention begins Aug. 19 in Chicago.\n\n * The sooner Biden is technically the nominee, the sooner he and the party can quash Democratic rebels' push to replace him on the ticket.\n\nBiden's team also has continued to tightly control his public appearances, even as many allies have urged him to be more spontaneous and ditch Teleprompters.\n\n * Biden's few unscripted moments in front of cameras since the June 27 debate haven't inspired wide confidence, but have been good enough to prevent many more defections.\n\nZoom in: Biden has done some interviews with subtle crutches.\n\n * In a phone chat with MSNBC's \"Morning Joe,\" Biden could be heard shuffling papers and acknowledged at one point that he was reading from \"a list of lies.\"\n * In his first interviews after the debate — radio calls with Black radio stations in Philadelphia and Milwaukee — his team later acknowledged it had drafted and pre-submitted the questions to the hosts.\n\nBiden's team also managed his calls with Democratic lawmakers.\n\n * Mayors and members of Congress could not unmute themselves in recent Zoom calls, as the White House controlled who was able to speak. The White House said that was standard procedure for such group calls.\n\nWhen the Congressional Hispanic Caucus jumped on a call with Biden, members were informed that \"this is a Zoom managed by the Biden campaign.\"\n\n * Biden's team said it was indeed controlling the call, but did not ask for nor receive questions in advance.\n\nWhat they're saying: White House spokesperson Andrew Bates told Axios that \"in the last two weeks, President Biden has done a one-hour, in-depth press conference and unscripted interviews with ABC News, 'Morning Joe,' BET, NBC News, Speedy Morman, and the Houston Chronicle.\"\n\n * Bates added: \"He has spoken off the cuff to world leaders — who highlighted the leadership he showed at NATO — as well as to members of Congress, the AFL-CIO, and to American veterans.\"\n\nProgressives also have cheered Biden's recent moves.\n\n * After the Congressional Progressive Caucus had a call with Biden, Rep. Brad Sherman (D-Calif.) told Axios the president teased many policies the caucus wants — which he said is \"not a complete coincidence,\" based on where Biden is now drawing support on Capitol Hill.\n * \"This is his base,\" Sherman said of the Progressive Caucus, \"You see who has called upon him to move on, and who has called upon him to stay, and the Progressive Caucus lines up with those who have asked him to stay.\"\n\nSanders penned an effusive op-ed in the New York Times for Biden's re-election over the weekend, and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) also has been publicly supportive.\n\n * Sanders wrote: \"Enough! Mr. Biden may not be the ideal candidate, but he will be the candidate and should be the candidate.\"\n\nThe influential Congressional Black Caucus also has largely been effusive in its support.\n\n * That's given Biden a lifeline with lawmakers representing two of the most important parts of the Democratic Party's base.\n\nBottom line: Some moderates are frustrated that they'll pay the price if Biden remains at the top of the ticket, unlike many progressives and members of the CBC who are largely in safely Democratic districts.\n\n * But the Biden team's moves have been sufficient to keep many Democrats from speaking out publicly.","feature_image":null,"featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"all","created_at":"2024-07-17 14:19:12","created_by":"1","updated_at":"2024-07-17 14:19:12","updated_by":null,"published_at":"2024-07-17 08:30:00","published_by":"1","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":"https://www.axios.com/2024/07/17/biden-rescue-operation-lean-left","newsletter_id":null,"show_title_and_feature_image":1},{"id":"6697d31010579c2fd4f6c479","uuid":"c5cc13ee-ddd1-4681-b569-6b64108a17aa","title":"Stephen Colbert Perfectly Takes Down Trump’s Republican Convention Enterance","slug":"stephen-colbert-perfectly-takes-down-trumps-republican-convention-enterance","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[],\"markups\":[[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://t.co/FyyF76P1Hf\",\"rel\",\"noopener noreferrer\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://twitter.com/PoliticusSarah/status/1813429198448394307?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\",\"rel\",\"noopener noreferrer\"]],[\"em\"],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://www.politicususa.com/2024/07/17/stephen-colbert-trump-convention.html\",\"rel\",\"noopener noreferrer\"]]],\"sections\":[[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"Stephen Colbert described Trump’s entrance during the second night of the GOP convention as being like Rocky Balboa if Rocky fought for Russia.\"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"Video:\"]]],[1,\"blockquote\",[[0,[],0,\"Stephen Colbert perfectly describes Trump's night 2 RMC entrance, \\\"At around 9:00 pm, Trump entered the arena like Rocky Balboa, if Rocky fought for Russia.\\\" \"],[0,[0],1,\"pic.twitter.com/FyyF76P1Hf\"]]],[1,\"blockquote\",[[0,[],0,\"— Sarah Reese Jones (@PoliticusSarah) \"],[0,[1],1,\"July 17, 2024\"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"Colbert said:\"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[2],1,\"At around 9 p.m. Something like that.
