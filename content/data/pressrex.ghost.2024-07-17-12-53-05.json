Results in early June indicated unsafe levels of E. coli bacteria, followed by recent improvements.\n\nThe Seine will host several open water swimming events during the Games, including marathon swimming at the Olympic Games and the swimming legs of the Olympic and Paralympic triathlons.\n\n—Barbara Surk in Nice, France contributed to this report.\n\nhttps://time.com/6999479/paris-mayor-anne-hidalgo-swim-seine-clean-river-olympics/","feature_image":null,"featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"all","created_at":"2024-07-17 12:48:54","created_by":"1","updated_at":"2024-07-17 12:48:54","updated_by":null,"published_at":"2024-07-17 07:45:00","published_by":"1","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":"https://time.com/6999479/paris-mayor-anne-hidalgo-swim-seine-clean-river-olympics/","newsletter_id":null,"show_title_and_feature_image":1},{"id":"6697be3293a5555684b7f16b","uuid":"a4288689-188d-47d2-8e93-5432a310ea9e","title":"Jon Stewart: We ‘Dodged a Catastrophe’ With Trump Shooting","slug":"jon-stewart-we-dodged-a-catastrophe-with-trump-shooting-2","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"image\",{\"src\":\"https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1682,w_2989,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1721195620/JS_z6ydho\"}]],\"markups\":[],\"sections\":[[10,0]],\"ghostVersion\":\"3.0\"}","lexical":null,"html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1682,w_2989,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1721195620/JS_z6ydho\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\"></figure>","comment_id":"6697bdb6e27079000113bfe0","plaintext":null,"feature_image":null,"featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"all","created_at":"2024-07-17 12:48:54","created_by":"1","updated_at":"2024-07-17 12:48:54","updated_by":null,"published_at":"2024-07-17 04:45:39","published_by":"1","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":"https://www.thedailybeast.com/jon-stewart-we-dodged-a-catastrophe-with-trump-shooting","newsletter_id":null,"show_title_and_feature_image":1},{"id":"6697be3293a5555684b7f16c","uuid":"0c9a9c90-debd-4145-982d-cd89ed495d95","title":"Who Is Usha Vance, J.D.

Vance said during the same interview that his wife’s faith was a key factor in his decision to re-engage with Christianity later in his life, which he says Usha has been supportive of.\n\nAsked if she’s ready for the scrutiny “that comes with being Second Lady,” Usha Vance told Fox: “I’m not raring to change anything about our lives right now, but I believe in J.D. and really love him, and so we’ll just sort of see what happens with our life.” She also suggested it was too soon to discuss what political causes she may champion if her husband becomes Vice President.\n\nhttps://time.com/6999385/usha-vance-jd-wife-indian-american-yale-law-hindu/","feature_image":null,"featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"all","created_at":"2024-07-17 12:48:54","created_by":"1","updated_at":"2024-07-17 12:48:54","updated_by":null,"published_at":"2024-07-17 03:35:00","published_by":"1","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":"https://time.com/6999385/usha-vance-jd-wife-indian-american-yale-law-hindu/","newsletter_id":null,"show_title_and_feature_image":1},{"id":"6697be3293a5555684b7f16d","uuid":"fe874373-e641-408f-bfb1-ed30e681f7d5","title":"‘House of the Dragon’ Showcases the Limits of Girlboss Feminism","slug":"house-of-the-dragon-showcases-the-limits-of-girlboss-feminism-2","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"image\",{\"src\":\"https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1688,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1721173524/240716-house-of-dragons-tease_pxc8xp\"}]],\"markups\":[],\"sections\":[[10,0]],\"ghostVersion\":\"3.0\"}","lexical":null,"html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1688,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1721173524/240716-house-of-dragons-tease_pxc8xp\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\"></figure>","comment_id":"6697bdb6e27079000113bfec","plaintext":null,"feature_image":null,"featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"all","created_at":"2024-07-17 12:48:54","created_by":"1","updated_at":"2024-07-17 12:48:54","updated_by":null,"published_at":"2024-07-17 08:30:12","published_by":"1","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":"https://www.thedailybeast.com/obsessed/house-of-the-dragon-showcases-the-limits-of-girlboss-feminism","newsletter_id":null,"show_title_and_feature_image":1},{"id":"6697be3293a5555684b7f16e","uuid":"aa98164f-a01c-49af-824c-263076b41d9b","title":"Malaysia Looks to Criminalize Cyberbullying After TikTok User’s Death","slug":"malaysia-looks-to-criminalize-cyberbullying-after-tiktok-users-death","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"image\",{\"src\":\"https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/tiktok-malaysia-suicide-cyberbullying.jpg?quality=85&w=1024&h=628&crop=1\"}],[\"image\",{\"src\":\"https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/tiktok-malaysia-suicide-cyberbullying.jpg\",\"alt\":\"The TikTok logo is seen on a mobile device screen\"}]],\"markups\":[[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://www.bernama.com/en/crime_courts/news.php?id=2317067\",\"rel\",\"noopener noreferrer\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2024/07/17/two-tiktok-users-charged\",\"rel\",\"noopener noreferrer\"]],[\"em\"],[\"strong\"],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://www.iasp.info/suicidalthoughts/\",\"rel\",\"noopener noreferrer\"]]],\"sections\":[[10,0],[10,1],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"The death of a Malaysian TikTok user has prompted the government to look into criminalizing cyberbullying and increasing accountability among internet service providers.\"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"Rajeswary Appahu was found dead from apparent suicide on July 5, a day after the 30-year-old lodged a police report over online threats she had received, local media \"],[0,[0],1,\"reported\"],[0,[],0,\".

When the armed man moved toward the unarmed man, police fired their weapons.\n\n“Someone’s life was in danger,” Norman said. “These officers, who were not from this area, took it upon themselves to act and save someone’s life today.”\n\nThousands of officers from multiple jurisdictions are in Milwaukee providing additional security for the convention that began Monday and concludes Thursday.\n\nRead More: How and When to Watch the 2024 Republican and Democratic Conventions\n\nThe shooting fueled anger from residents who questioned why out-of-state officers were in their neighborhood located about a mile from the convention site.\n\nThe Columbus Division of Police, as well as the chief of staff for Milwaukee’s mayor and a spokesperson for the convention’s joint command center, all said there was nothing to suggest the shooting was related to the convention itself.\n\nA cousin and others identified the man killed as 43-year-old Samuel Sharpe.\n\nMilwaukee residents and activists quickly converged on the site of the shooting, many of them expressing outrage about the involvement of a police department in town because of the convention.\n\nAbout 100 people held a vigil and march without incident on Tuesday night, pausing for a moment of silence at the blood-stained spot where Sharpe was killed.\n\n“They came into our community and shot down our family right here at a public park,” said Linda Sharpe, a cousin of the man who was killed. “What are you doing in our city, shooting people down?”\n\nLinda Sharpe said her cousin lived in a tent encampment across the street from King Park, where the shooting occurred.\n\nResidents said the encampment was a long-standing feature of the neighborhood, which is home to several social service clinics and a shelter. Some said Milwaukee police officers are familiar with many of those living in the tents and might have been able to deescalate the situation.\n\nRead More: History Suggests the Supreme Court’s Homelessness Ruling Will Only Make the Problem Worse\n\nDavid Porter, who said he knew Samuel Sharpe and is also homeless, was angry that officers from outside of Milwaukee were in his neighborhood.\n\n“If MPD would have been there, that man would still be alive right now,” Porter said, referring to Milwaukee police.\n\nNorman, the Milwaukee chief, said 13 officers who were part of a bicycle patrol from Columbus were within their assigned zone having a meeting when they saw the altercation.\n\n“The officers observed a subject armed with a knife in each hand, engaged in an altercation with another unarmed individual,” Norman said. They only fired after the armed man ignored multiple commands and moved toward the unarmed man, the chief said.\n\n“This is a situation where somebody’s life was in immediate danger,” Norman said.\n\nThe Columbus Division of Police has received attention because of its special unit deployed to Milwaukee that works to improve police-community relationships and had a visible role in guiding the largely uneventful protests on Monday.\n\nThe shooting happened near King Park, roughly a mile from the convention center, where a small group of protesters gathered before marching on Monday. That demonstration was followed by dozens of Columbus police officers, wearing blue vests that read: “Columbus Police Dialogue.”\n\nThe Milwaukee County Medical Examiner’s Office said an autopsy was scheduled for Wednesday.\n\nhttps://time.com/6999394/officers-fatally-shot-man-blocks-away-rnc/","feature_image":null,"featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"all","created_at":"2024-07-17

It produces about 90% of all advanced microchips globally.\n\nThe US' relationship with Taiwan is likely to be a sore point should former President Donald Trump secure a second term in office.\n\nTrump, the Republican presidential nominee, said to Bloomberg Businessweek about Taiwan's dominance in the chip industry that made the island rich. He offered no evidence in the interview to support his claims about Taiwan.\n\n\"Taiwan took our chip business from us,\" he told Businessweek in an interview before the failed assassination attempt on Saturday. \"I mean, how stupid are we? They took all of our chip business. They're immensely wealthy.\"\n\nTaiwan is a semiconductor chip powerhouse. It produces 92% of the world's most advanced microchips, according to the US-based Semiconductor Industry Association.\n\nIn 2021, Taiwan's chip industry generated $137 billion in output and accounted for nearly 25% of total global chip sales, according to the US International Trade Commission in a November report.\n\nTaiwan's chipmakers benefit US companies. TSMC is the world's largest contract chipmaker: The company supplies chips to end users in America like Apple, which uses them in their consumer products. AI chipmaker Nvidia is also a big TSMC customer.\n\nHowever, Beijing claims self-governed Taiwan as its own territory and has been stepping up military activity around the island in recent years. That has sparked fears of a Chinese invasion of the island that could majorly impact the global economy and chip supply.\n\nThe US is ramping up chip manufacturing at home to diversify some of its chip supply from Taiwan with the $52 billion CHIPS for America Act that was signed into law by President Joe Biden in August 2022.\n\nThe US is still obliged by law to protect Taiwan by providing the island with military means to defend itself.\n\n\"I think, Taiwan should pay us for defense,\" Trump told Bloomberg. \"You know, we're no different than an insurance company. Taiwan doesn't give us anything.\"\n\nTaiwan-listed shares of chip powerhouse Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company stock fell as much as 3% on Thursday following Trump's complaints.\n\nIn response to Trump's statement, Taiwanese Premier Cho Jung-tai said on Thursday that the US and Taiwan maintain a good relationship and that Taipei has strengthened its defense budget.\n\n\"We are willing to take on more responsibility to defend ourselves and ensure our security,\" Cho said at a scheduled press conference.\n\n\nChina probably hasn't decided if it prefers Trump or Biden\n\nIt's not the first time Trump has complained about Taiwan's dominance in the chip business. Last July, he also griped to Fox News about the same issue.\n\n\"Remember this, Taiwan took our business away. We should have stopped them, we should have taxed them, tariffed them,\" he said at the time.\n\nChina earlier highlighted the US' potential turnaround from Biden's stance that the US would come to the defense of Taiwan if it's attacked.\n\n\"The United States always pursues 'America First,' and Taiwan may change from a 'chess piece' to a 'discarded piece' at any time,\" said Chen Binhua, a spokesman for China's Taiwan Affairs Office in January.\n\nBut it's likely China has not decided whether it would prefer a Biden or Trump presidency, wrote Yun Sun, a nonresident fellow at the Brookings Institution, on May 31.\n\nAfter all, Trump's first term saw his administration lifting US government rules restricting interactions between American and Taiwanese officials — a deepening of their relationship.\n\n\"China doesn't believe Trump wanted a war with China over Taiwan, but they do see his indulgence of his team on Taiwan as the result of his overall 'maximum pressure' campaign to force China to cave on other fronts, such as trade,\" wrote Sun.\n\nRead the original article on Business Insiderhttps://www.businessinsider.com/donald-trump-taiwan-took-chip-business-pay-us-protection-manufacturing-2024-7","feature_image":null,"featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"all","created_at":"2024-07-17 12:48:56","created_by":"1","updated_at":"2024-07-17 12:48:56","updated_by":null,"published_at":"2024-07-17 06:56:04","published_by":"1","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":"https://www.businessinsider.com/donald-trump-taiwan-took-chip-business-pay-us-protection-manufacturing-2024-7","newsletter_id":null,"show_title_and_feature_image":1},{"id":"6697be3293a5555684b7f181","uuid":"353e27ec-670a-4a76-8045-2bbcaf5cf0be","title":"Reality Star Savannah Chrisley Given Primetime RNC Slot to Attack the DOJ","slug":"reality-star-savannah-chrisley-given-primetime-rnc-slot-to-attack-the-doj-2","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"image\",{\"src\":\"https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_2088,w_3712,x_0,y_164/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1721170577/GettyImages-1992936481_1_hqbnfj\"}]],\"markups\":[],\"sections\":[[10,0]],\"ghostVersion\":\"3.0\"}","lexical":null,"html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_2088,w_3712,x_0,y_164/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1721170577/GettyImages-1992936481_1_hqbnfj\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\"></figure>","comment_id":"6697bdb8e27079000113c064","plaintext":null,"feature_image":null,"featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"all","created_at":"2024-07-17 12:48:56","created_by":"1","updated_at":"2024-07-17 12:48:56","updated_by":null,"published_at":"2024-07-16 23:49:53","published_by":"1","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":"https://www.thedailybeast.com/reality-star-savannah-chrisley-given-primetime-rnc-slot-to-attack-the-doj","newsletter_id":null,"show_title_and_feature_image":1},{"id":"6697be3293a5555684b7f182","uuid":"7905ec21-55fb-4dc5-be9b-6abf08c47742","title":"Trump is considering giving Jamie Dimon, who he once called a 'highly overrated globalist,' a prime Cabinet position","slug":"trump-is-considering-giving-jamie-dimon-who-he-once-called-a-highly-overrated-globalist-a-prime-cabinet-position","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"image\",{\"src\":\"https://i.insider.com/669736aa9caa6ed01e023847?width=1200&format=jpeg\"}],[\"image\",{\"src\":\"https://i.insider.com/669736448893442a5157356f?format=jpeg\",\"alt\":\"Jamie Dimon testifying during a Senate Banking Committee hearing;

The former president called Dimon a \"highly overrated globalist\" in a November Truth Social post.\n\n\"I've never been a big Jamie Dimon fan, but had to live with this guy when he came begging to the White House. I guess I don't have to live with him anymore, and that's a really good thing!\" Trump wrote in November.\n\nRight-wing figures use the word \"globalist\" to refer to a fringe conspiracy theory about a cabal of elite individuals secretly controlling the world. Trump has been known to use the term as an insult — he called his former protégé, Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida, a \"RINO globalist.\"\n\nBut it looks like Trump may be feeling differently about Dimon now.\n\nFor one, Haley is no longer a threat to Trump's presidential ambitions. The former South Carolina governor ended her presidential campaign in March and endorsed Trump at the Republican National Convention on Tuesday.\n\nDimon also softened his stance on Trump and praised the former president's policy record in January.\n\n\"He's kind of right about NATO. Kind of right about immigration,\" Dimon told CNBC at the World Economic Forum's annual meeting in Davos. \"He grew the economy quite well. Tax reform worked. He was right about some of China.\"\n\n\"I don't like how Trump said things, but he wasn't wrong about those critical issues. That's why they're voting for him. People should be more respectful of our fellow citizens,\" says @JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon. \"I think this negative talk about MAGA will hurt Biden's campaign.\" pic.twitter.com/WKnDjBvefOJanuary 17, 2024\n\nTo be sure, Dimon hasn't indicated that he plans to leave JPMorgan anytime soon. During the bank's investor day in May, Dimon said he intends to stay on for another three-and-a-half years, per Reuters.\n\nThat said, Dimon hasn't ruled out a career in politics entirely.\n\n\"Obviously, it's crossed my mind because people mention things to you and stuff like that. I love my country, and maybe one day I'll serve my country in one capacity or another,\" Dimon told Bloomberg TV in May.\n\nRepresentatives for Trump and Dimon didn't immediately respond to requests

This time, the deal that we're all stoked about is almost $150 off the Vitamix 5200, the hero deal of threads like this one and this one. It also happens to be our pick for the best blender after testing and consulting with nutritionists.\n\nHere are the best Amazon Prime Day deals on products that both we and Reddit recommend so you know you're only getting the best.\n\n\nTop 8 deals\n\n\nOur guides that feature these Amazon Prime Day deals\n\n * Best hair dryers\n * Best air fryers\n * Best Apple AirPods\n * Best Apple iPads\n *

only policies endorsed by President Trump for a second term, adding that \"Team Biden and the DNC are LYING and fear-mongering because they have NOTHING else to offer the American people.\"\n\nThough he denies knowing anything about the project, the playbook mentions Trump's name more than 300 times.\n\nKevin Roberts, the president of The Heritage Foundation, noted in a July 10 episode of \"The Vince Coglianese Show\" that there's a \"tremendous\" amount of overlap between Trump's Agenda 47 and Project 2025 — and the standard Republican platform more generally.\n\nRoberts said there were \"no hard feelings from any of us at Project 2025\" about Trump's statement denouncing their agenda, saying \"he's making a political tactical decision there\" in response to a swath of bad press about the playbook's extreme policies.\n\n\"I think what you're going to see is the beginning of a golden era of conservative reform,\" Roberts added. \"Not just because of President Trump, although he deserves most of the credit, but because the rest of the conservative movement has realized this is the moment if we have the leader and the plan that we're able to begin to undo all of the wreckage of the radical left of the last several decades.\"\n\nRead the original article on Business
