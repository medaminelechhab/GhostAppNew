Vance said during the same interview that his wife’s faith was a key factor in his decision to re-engage with Christianity later in his life, which he says Usha has been supportive of.\n\nAsked if she’s ready for the scrutiny “that comes with being Second Lady,” Usha Vance told Fox: “I’m not raring to change anything about our lives right now, but I believe in J.D. and really love him, and so we’ll just sort of see what happens with our life.” She also suggested it was too soon to discuss what political causes she may champion if her husband becomes Vice President.\n\nhttps://time.com/6999385/usha-vance-jd-wife-indian-american-yale-law-hindu/","feature_image":null,"featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"all","created_at":"2024-07-17 12:48:54","created_by":"1","updated_at":"2024-07-17 12:48:54","updated_by":null,"published_at":"2024-07-17 03:35:00","published_by":"1","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":"https://time.com/6999385/usha-vance-jd-wife-indian-american-yale-law-hindu/","newsletter_id":null,"show_title_and_feature_image":1},{"id":"6697bfe410579c2fd4f6bb1a","uuid":"fe874373-e641-408f-bfb1-ed30e681f7d5","title":"‘House of the Dragon’ Showcases the Limits of Girlboss Feminism","slug":"house-of-the-dragon-showcases-the-limits-of-girlboss-feminism-2","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"image\",{\"src\":\"https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1688,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1721173524/240716-house-of-dragons-tease_pxc8xp\"}]],\"markups\":[],\"sections\":[[10,0]],\"ghostVersion\":\"3.0\"}","lexical":null,"html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1688,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1721173524/240716-house-of-dragons-tease_pxc8xp\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\"></figure>","comment_id":"6697bdb6e27079000113bfec","plaintext":null,"feature_image":null,"featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"all","created_at":"2024-07-17 12:48:54","created_by":"1","updated_at":"2024-07-17 12:48:54","updated_by":null,"published_at":"2024-07-17 08:30:12","published_by":"1","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":"https://www.thedailybeast.com/obsessed/house-of-the-dragon-showcases-the-limits-of-girlboss-feminism","newsletter_id":null,"show_title_and_feature_image":1},{"id":"6697bfe410579c2fd4f6bb1b","uuid":"aa98164f-a01c-49af-824c-263076b41d9b","title":"Malaysia Looks to Criminalize Cyberbullying After TikTok User’s Death","slug":"malaysia-looks-to-criminalize-cyberbullying-after-tiktok-users-death","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"image\",{\"src\":\"https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/tiktok-malaysia-suicide-cyberbullying.jpg?quality=85&w=1024&h=628&crop=1\"}],[\"image\",{\"src\":\"https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/tiktok-malaysia-suicide-cyberbullying.jpg\",\"alt\":\"The TikTok logo is seen on a mobile device screen\"}]],\"markups\":[[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://www.bernama.com/en/crime_courts/news.php?id=2317067\",\"rel\",\"noopener noreferrer\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2024/07/17/two-tiktok-users-charged\",\"rel\",\"noopener noreferrer\"]],[\"em\"],[\"strong\"],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://www.iasp.info/suicidalthoughts/\",\"rel\",\"noopener noreferrer\"]]],\"sections\":[[10,0],[10,1],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"The death of a Malaysian TikTok user has prompted the government to look into criminalizing cyberbullying and increasing accountability among internet service providers.\"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"Rajeswary Appahu was found dead from apparent suicide on July 5, a day after the 30-year-old lodged a police report over online threats she had received, local media \"],[0,[0],1,\"reported\"],[0,[],0,\".

It produces 92% of the world's most advanced microchips, according to the US-based Semiconductor Industry Association.\n\nIn 2021, Taiwan's chip industry generated $137 billion in output and accounted for nearly 25% of total global chip sales, according to the US International Trade Commission in a November report.\n\nTaiwan's chipmakers benefit US companies. TSMC is the world's largest contract chipmaker: The company supplies chips to end users in America like Apple, which uses them in their consumer products. AI chipmaker Nvidia is also a big TSMC customer.\n\nHowever, Beijing claims self-governed Taiwan as its own territory and has been stepping up military activity around the island in recent years. That has sparked fears of a Chinese invasion of the island that could majorly impact the global economy and chip supply.\n\nThe US is ramping up chip manufacturing at home to diversify some of its chip supply from Taiwan with the $52 billion CHIPS for America Act that was signed into law by President Joe Biden in August 2022.\n\nThe US is still obliged by law to protect Taiwan by providing the island with military means to defend itself.\n\n\"I think, Taiwan should pay us for defense,\" Trump told Bloomberg. \"You know, we're no different than an insurance company. Taiwan doesn't give us anything.\"\n\nTaiwan-listed shares of chip powerhouse Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company stock fell as much as 3% on Thursday following Trump's complaints.\n\nIn response to Trump's statement, Taiwanese Premier Cho Jung-tai said on Thursday that the US and Taiwan maintain a good relationship and that Taipei has strengthened its defense budget.\n\n\"We are willing to take on more responsibility to defend ourselves and ensure our security,\" Cho said at a scheduled press conference.\n\n\nChina probably hasn't decided if it prefers Trump or Biden\n\nIt's not the first time Trump has complained about Taiwan's dominance in the chip business. Last July, he also griped to Fox News about the same issue.\n\n\"Remember this, Taiwan took our business away. We should have stopped them, we should have taxed them, tariffed them,\" he said at the time.\n\nChina earlier highlighted the US' potential turnaround from Biden's stance that the US would come to the defense of Taiwan if it's attacked.\n\n\"The United States always pursues 'America First,' and Taiwan may change from a 'chess piece' to a 'discarded piece' at any time,\" said Chen Binhua, a spokesman for China's Taiwan Affairs Office in January.\n\nBut it's likely China has not decided whether it would prefer a Biden or Trump presidency, wrote Yun Sun, a nonresident fellow at the Brookings Institution, on May 31.\n\nAfter all, Trump's first term saw his administration lifting US government rules restricting interactions between American and Taiwanese officials — a deepening of their relationship.\n\n\"China doesn't believe Trump wanted a war with China over Taiwan, but they do see his indulgence of his team on Taiwan as the result of his overall 'maximum pressure' campaign to force China to cave on other fronts, such as trade,\" wrote Sun.\n\nRead the original article on Business Insiderhttps://www.businessinsider.com/donald-trump-taiwan-took-chip-business-pay-us-protection-manufacturing-2024-7","feature_image":null,"featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"all","created_at":"2024-07-17 12:48:56","created_by":"1","updated_at":"2024-07-17 12:48:56","updated_by":null,"published_at":"2024-07-17 06:56:04","published_by":"1","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":"https://www.businessinsider.com/donald-trump-taiwan-took-chip-business-pay-us-protection-manufacturing-2024-7","newsletter_id":null,"show_title_and_feature_image":1},{"id":"6697bfe410579c2fd4f6bb2e","uuid":"353e27ec-670a-4a76-8045-2bbcaf5cf0be","title":"Reality Star Savannah Chrisley Given Primetime RNC Slot to Attack the DOJ","slug":"reality-star-savannah-chrisley-given-primetime-rnc-slot-to-attack-the-doj-2","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"image\",{\"src\":\"https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_2088,w_3712,x_0,y_164/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1721170577/GettyImages-1992936481_1_hqbnfj\"}]],\"markups\":[],\"sections\":[[10,0]],\"ghostVersion\":\"3.0\"}","lexical":null,"html":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_2088,w_3712,x_0,y_164/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1721170577/GettyImages-1992936481_1_hqbnfj\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\"></figure>","comment_id":"6697bdb8e27079000113c064","plaintext":null,"feature_image":null,"featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"all","created_at":"2024-07-17 12:48:56","created_by":"1","updated_at":"2024-07-17 12:48:56","updated_by":null,"published_at":"2024-07-16 23:49:53","published_by":"1","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":"https://www.thedailybeast.com/reality-star-savannah-chrisley-given-primetime-rnc-slot-to-attack-the-doj","newsletter_id":null,"show_title_and_feature_image":1},{"id":"6697bfe410579c2fd4f6bb2f","uuid":"7905ec21-55fb-4dc5-be9b-6abf08c47742","title":"Trump is considering giving Jamie Dimon, who he once called a 'highly overrated globalist,' a prime Cabinet position","slug":"trump-is-considering-giving-jamie-dimon-who-he-once-called-a-highly-overrated-globalist-a-prime-cabinet-position","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"image\",{\"src\":\"https://i.insider.com/669736aa9caa6ed01e023847?width=1200&format=jpeg\"}],[\"image\",{\"src\":\"https://i.insider.com/669736448893442a5157356f?format=jpeg\",\"alt\":\"Jamie Dimon testifying during a Senate Banking Committee hearing;

We've not only tested the Dyson Airwrap, but also all of the best Dyson Airwrap dupes, so we can give you the full picture on value.\n\nBut sometimes Kismet happens, and we and Reddit are super passionate about the same deals.

Now, a new paper from a team of Italian researchers offers the most convincing evidence yet.\n\n\"Lunar caves have remained a mystery for over 50 years. So it was exciting to be able to finally prove the existence,\" authors Leonardo Carrer and Lorenzo Bruzzone of the University of Trento told The Associated Press.\n\nThe team speculates that, given how they think this cave formed, there could be hundreds more hidden under the lunar surface. Instead of building homes on the moon, we could inhabit the existing caverns beneath it.\n\n\nHow such a large cave formed on the moon\n\nJudging from the data, the researchers estimate the cave is approximately 150 feet wide and up to 260 feet long, which is slightly smaller than an American football field with the end zones cut off.\n\nThe cave sits deep within a pit, called the Mare Tranquillitatis pit, which likely formed when a lava tube collapsed.
